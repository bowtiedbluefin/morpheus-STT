And Mr. Jarrett has a request for information. Oh, I'm sorry. I did not hear you, Mr. Jarrett. Okay. Go ahead, miss Miss Dunn. It says all use of freestanding camera stands including but limited to tripods, camera stands, and other physical devices used to support or elevate cameras, cell phones, or other video recording devices is restricted to an area to be designated by the city clerk in the Northeast corner of the city council chambers. Okay. Seeing that that those are, used to elevate cameras, you must go back to the videography area or remove yourself from this meeting or it won't have to be removed. It says freestanding. Freestanding. Anything that is freestanding that is used to elevate it. Point of order. Yes. What's your point? I did give that to the city attorney so that he could take a look. He may need time to to look at it, because he did not have that before. Yes. So I I mean, this I wish can we just go on with the meeting while they're figuring out? I I did not receive Oh, it didn't come through? Anything? No. Okay. I'll resend it. Okay. We will we will pause that on that, but I am asking you to remove yourself as soon as we get an opinion. Go ahead. This is the, discussion. We're at discussion we're at the first round on resolution 250,131 members speaking were, Mr. Pfeiffer, Doctor. Lewis, and Ms. Michette is there any other discussion on this resolution in the first round? Seeing none, I'll entertain any discussion on the second round. Is anyone Madam Chair. Speak in the second round? Madam Chair. Go ahead. Okay. So, I heard that the rationale for not moving forward with this was because of the the lack of, attorney, 1 attorney in the law office. So through you to the compliment in Eighth Ward, so, how does that, hold a bearing on this resolution? I mean, we can laugh, but it's a city business, so that's fine. So the councilman in the Eighth Ward refused to ask a question. That Mister Woodson, you may leave. Yes. He did get a warning. He got a warning earlier. Madam Chair? This is your warning. Is that a reference for me? It will be possible. Hold on. But this is your this is your warning. Fire will miss you. Is there any other discussion in the second round? So, as I was saying, I I didn't finish my time. Oh, go ahead. Yeah. It's not a problem. So I asked the councilman in the Eighth Ward what was the what was the link between the 2 so we can have an understanding. And according to our rules, you ask a request through the chair for the information so it can help you decide your next vote. And that's exactly what I was doing. And so since the councilman in the Eighth Ward refused to engage per his requested duty as a councilman, now we don't have information. And we're sitting over here mad. This is when we talk about personalities taking over the job. We we can't afford to have this happen. We must be consistent with the rules, and we must work with colleagues. If we're not gonna work with colleagues, please continue to stay home, take another absent again. But those that come, we're here to do the work. And giggling and laughing about the work not taking place is not funny. So, and I would like to definitely compel my colleague in the a ward. You've been missing for several weeks. Please go and then take care of your loved ones. Point of order. Wasn't the colleague absent in the last meeting? And she's gonna call me absent? Yeah. I well well, thank you. And so and so if you wanna talk about that point of order, I had a conversation with the chair. They knew why I was not here. Okay? So we we must make sure that we keep the main thing the main thing. The main thing is

I did not hear you, Mr. Jarrett. Okay. Go ahead, miss Miss Dunn.\n\nSpeaker 1: It says all use of freestanding camera stands including but limited to tripods, camera stands, and other physical devices used to support or elevate cameras, cell phones, or other video recording devices is restricted to an area to be designated by the city clerk in the Northeast corner of the city council chambers.\n\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Seeing that that those are, used to elevate cameras, you must go back to the videography area or remove yourself from this meeting or it won't have to be removed.\n\nSpeaker 2: It says freestanding. Freestanding. Anything that is freestanding that is used to elevate it.\n\nSpeaker 3: Point of order. Yes. What's your point? I did give that to the city attorney so that he could take a look. He may need time to to look at it, because he did not have that before.\n\nSpeaker 4: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 3: So I I mean, this I wish can we just go on with the meeting while they're figuring out?\n\nSpeaker 4: I I did not receive\n\nSpeaker 3: Oh, it didn't come through?

So, I heard that the rationale for not moving forward with this was because of the the lack of, attorney, 1 attorney in the law office. So through you to the compliment in Eighth Ward, so, how does that, hold a bearing on this resolution? I mean, we can laugh, but it's a city business, so that's fine. So the councilman in the Eighth Ward refused to ask a question.\n\nThat\n\nSpeaker 0: Mister Woodson, you may leave. Yes. He did get a warning. He got a warning earlier.\n\nSpeaker 4: Madam Chair?\n\nSpeaker 0: This is your warning.\n\nSpeaker 4: Is that a reference for me?\n\nSpeaker 0: It will be possible.\n\nSpeaker 4: Hold\n\nSpeaker 0: on. But this is your this is your warning.\n\nSpeaker 4: Fire will miss you.\n\nSpeaker 0: Is there any other discussion in the second round?\n\nSpeaker 4: So, as I was saying, I I didn't finish my time.\n\nSpeaker 0: Oh, go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 4: Yeah. It's not a problem. So I asked the councilman in the Eighth Ward what was the what was the link between the 2 so we can have an understanding. And according to our rules, you ask a request through the chair for the information so it can help you decide your next vote. And that's exactly what I was doing.\n\nAnd so since the councilman in the Eighth Ward refused to engage per his requested duty as a councilman, now we don't have information. And we're sitting over here mad. This is when we talk about personalities taking over the job. We we can't afford to have this happen. We must be consistent with the rules, and we must work with colleagues.\n\nIf we're not gonna work with colleagues, please continue to stay home, take another absent again. But those that come, we're here to do the work. And giggling and laughing about the work not taking place is not funny. So, and I would like to definitely compel my colleague in the a ward. You've been missing for several weeks.\n\nPlease go and then take care of\n\nSpeaker 2: your loved ones. Point of order. Wasn't the colleague absent in the last meeting? And she's gonna call\n\nSpeaker 4: me absent? Yeah. I well well, thank you. And so and so if you wanna talk about that point of order, I had a conversation with the chair. They knew why I was not here.\n\nOkay? So we we must make sure that we keep the main thing the main thing.
