If available, it's gonna be brought back at a later date. Probably the new, board will have to deal with it in next month. So if I could have a motion that we Yeah. Do we know what the, hold up is? I don't have the slightest idea. I really don't. As I understand from the city attorney, it's just slow going and and all the details are being examined.

It's just been a pleasure serving with you over the last 8 years, and, it's been a great board. And, I think we've, over the last several years, it's probably been the best I've seen, and, it's been a pleasure working with you. I wish you luck because you're gonna need it. Thanks. I think. We thank him for that. I'm not sure. I I Seriously, thank you. Yeah. I wanna also echo those thoughts as my email lets you know. Yes. And thank thank John and Phil for all their service and all their help. Yeah. 1 thing I hope that you really keep working on the board, Saturday hours. Hours. As my time is present, that's 1 thing I've heard the most about, the Saturday hours. I think they're just so important to the community. And I wish the board a lot of luck because there's a lot of, cuts coming in the budget. And I hope you all fight together and just hold the library because it's very important to the community. And it's meant an awful lot to me over the 30 years, so I hope that the board just keeps pounding and make sure that the library keeps vibrant and going. And I'm sure with you in charge of it, you know, it'll be going that way, and you, MacLeod, and Susan. So thank you again. I think it's it's the board's work, but thank you. Thank you, Joe. Thank you. Thanks, Phil. Yeah. Alright. Let's move on to the approve the minutes from the April 23 regular meeting. Any changes to them? Make a motion to approve the April 23 minutes. Okay. Do I have a second? Go ahead. I second. Alright. Let's have a roll call, please. Marie Claire Gorham. Yes. John Krisscher. Yes. Susan Murphy. Yes. Phil Pardue. Yes. Mary Jo Williams. Yes. It is unanimous. Thank you. Okay. Now we received the librarian's report for April 25. Do we have to approve the special meeting minutes or yes. We do need to approve the special. I'm sorry. I'm gonna just we could have done them all as 1 budget. No. We did all as 1 on Monday. It's okay. Alright. We have a motion to Make a motion to approve the special meeting minutes. Seconded. Alright. May I have a roll call, please? Marie Claire Gorham. Yes. John Krisscher. Yes. Susan Murphy. Yes. Phil Pardue. Yes. Mary Jo Williams. Yes. Alright. Miss Hannemas. Now we'll move on to the librarians report. Thank you. That's okay. So for the librarians report, no big announcements there. Slight dip in adult circulation, bump up in kids' circulation. This is this was the month of Easter. So we saw travel people traveling during this month, and then we also saw kids off of school, so more kids in the library. So depending on your circumstances, you could have been out of town. So it's it's we see these bump ups and downs whenever there's the holidays, or time off if there's, you know, fall break with kids, we see more foot traffic and things like that. Are there any questions about librarians report overall? No big anomalies there? Okay. That's it. Okay. Alright. Let's move on to the treasurer's report and check register. Just gonna say, in general, looking at this month as well that we would run lean. To my math, expenses came in 13% under budget, so that's, doing great. And, yeah, efficient spending. And, yeah, we're we're on on track to stay lean. Anybody? Yeah. Yeah. Any questions? Alright. Then we'll have a motion to approve the check register, please. For which month? Check check register for which month? Oh, I think April. April. April '20 fifth. Make a motion to approve the, April, check register. Can I have a second, please? I second it. Roll call. Reclaire Gorham. Yes. John Krisscher. Yes. Susan Murphy. Yes. Phil Pardue. Yes. Mary Jo Williams. Yes. Deanna Miss. Thank you. Alex, could we have the Public Library Foundation's, recent activities? Good morning, trustees. Good morning, Morning. So, at our last meeting, we approved our budget for 2526. We approved the slate of officers. We also approved 2 new board members, and we approved to move forward, and to release the funds for the Centennial Restoration Project for phase 1. Lot of approvals. And we're continuing to work on raising funds for the Centennial Restoration. We're working with the city to help finalize the architect agreement as well. And, we're also working on new programs for next year, including that's it. That's what I have so far. Any questions, though? No. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Alright. Alright. We'll see a report from the library relocation ad hoc committee. So on behalf of the ad hoc committee, work continues apace. We have 3 potential locations, and we are still trying to get some of those details nailed down so that we can bring a full report to the board of trustees for further discussion. So that when we do start to move forward, with a renovation project, we have things planned out and situated for where library operations will, be held, for continuity of operations so that it's seamless. Any any additions to that, Mary Claire or Mary Jo? No? We've been doing our tours. Yes. Yes. Excited. Asking lots of questions. Yes. Making more charts. Yes. On tour. Yes. So we have 3 3 places right now. 3 places. Yes. Okay. And which 1 will be Sunset Center is probably the best, you think? I think it's the remains our simplest solution, but it's still it's Yeah. We've we've the tail. We're so thankful details. We're so thankful that the community is, in some cases, has stepped forward when they heard about this project and said we're we would be interested in hosting you. So, the spaces that we're talking to people about and considering and asking questions are the Sunset Center, the Church of the Wayfarer, and the Carmel Youth Center. And again, grateful that, you know, when we when we first started this process, we weren't sure if we were gonna find a space in town, and now we have 3 to compare and contrast against. And 3 really great community partners that we work with. Church of the Wayfarer used to host, the Friends of the Library author, Visit and Tea before the Carmel Public Library Foundation did this. So we we have these established relationships. Sunset Center obviously hosts a lot of the library programs and city meetings. And then Carmel Youth Center, we have partnered with them on children's programs before. So all of these make good sense and, we're gonna continue our studies as we go forward. So if you all, if you all have a, earliest possible move date in mind so you can start working? Because I mean, I know it's fluid right now, but if everything goes well, what would be the earliest date that you think you'd, need to move in, or you plan it for? So based on, based on I mean, the the goal ultimate goal is to complete a renovation in 2028. So working backwards from that date and time, probably mid 20 26 or fall of 20 26 would be when we'd wanna move in because we still need to go through the design process Mhmm. With the architect and we still need to go out to bid, for a contractor. And the the bidding process alone takes, you know, between 3 and 6 months depending. So we've got some time ahead of us and that's something that we have communicated with the free spaces is that that while we're doing this now, to be ahead of the game and, again, ensure continuity of operations, we're still a bit a bit of a ways off at least a year out from potential occupation of another space. Okay. Plenty of time. Plenty of time, but we like to do our due diligence. And that that plenty of time though will go quickly. It will go very quickly, to ask these questions and to make sure that if there's programs happening in spaces that we found alternate locations or solutions for accommodating those types of things going on within a library space, which makes sense in a lot of cases. Having the equipment we need, shelves, all of that. So it will it will be vast. Right. Once you get the architectural contract done, you'll have a better idea of which 1 will be. Exactly. Right. But but right now, we're telling, the people that we're talking to, you're a year and a half out. Got it. I mean, John, you commissioned us to start working on this almost a year ago, recognizing that it's gonna be 1 of the very first questions. Right? What's gonna happen to the library operations when all this is happening? And we need to have a pretty cogent answer. Sooner versus later. But it is hard they're all great spaces. They all have some great, benefits, but they all have some drawbacks. So it's, you know, I think and it's just trying to figure out Right. Which which is really the most viable. Yeah. Which Right. And as and as John, you know, again, getting this started earlier Yeah. Rather than later, the wounds of having the library closed for, you know, during the pandemic are still there. And nobody wants to see the library shut down again. Right. And so we wanna keep operations going, in a different location. You know, I would love to see us be closed for, you know, only a week in between, because we're so well organized, we can just open right back up again. That's Keep things going. Yeah. So Alright. We'll move on then. Okay. Let's adopt a 20 20 25, 20 27 Sysico plan, which I reading it, a lot of work went into it. And I appreciate everybody that served on it. Okay. It's been I think I've did a quite a fantastic job. Thank you for that, president Krisscher. We didn't receive any major feedback from the public. I had a few grammatical things here and there, formatting things, switch this around, which those were incorporated into the strategic plan, but nothing. And I think we saw this, when we did our 2 community outreach meetings last spring at this time where we saw low attendance and participation partly because mainly the people the the things that people wanna see are Saturday hours and then that list of programs that fit in within our objectives. And so, again, we'll continue to do what we do. I think our staff does very well is listen to the public on a day to daily basis so that we can recalibrate our operations. But I feel very proud of the work that went into this plan. We had a very dynamic group of strategic planners. I appreciate all of the work that the trustees put into going through this line by line at the last special meeting. And this is something I'd like I think would be great, especially with the just uncertainty, especially with economics and state library. We talked about with our financial policy, doing more in-depth quarterly budget reviews, especially if we wanna pull back on, amount of money needed from the disbursement from CPLF to also be doing quarterly reviews rather than, semiannual reviews of the strategic plan. And I have started a strategic plan. And I have started a work plan for the staff, for, you know, year 2025 to assign, out objectives and to start talking to everybody about that once this is adopted. And that's a plan I can I I talked to I spoke about last month about bringing back to the board of trustees so you can see what that looks like? Yeah. Yeah. So we, went through it. I guess, we made a couple recommended changes, like, it went to the mission statement. I don't know if there's anything else through there. Those changes have been made. No others All of those changes have been made. Before. Mhmm. Exactly. Any other questions or thoughts about it? No. No. It's it's a good plan. Mhmm. I feel I feel good about it. I feel like it's a solid plan that we can really make some headway on over the next few years. Yes. You had community input, which has really helped that way. I did. So it's out there. Mhmm. Alright. So we have to have a a motion on that or anything? Yes. Please. Have a motion to adopt the plan? Make a motion to adopt the, the 2025 strategic plan for the library. Do I have a second? I'll I'll second that. Okay. Can I have a roll call, please? Mary Jo and I have Marie Claire Gordon. Yes. John Krisscher. Yes. Susan Murphy. Yes. Phil Pardew. Yes. Mary Jo Williams. Yes. Wonderful. Thank you. Alright. Thank you very much. Now we move on to the next of the adopt the fiscal year budget for 20 25, 20 26. Which any comments from anybody on this before, Ashley? So, we went through the budget for, over the last 2 meetings, the last regular meeting and then the special meeting that we had last month. I have made those recalibrations as we discussed with Flipster, parks passes, elimination of that service. I still I'm supposed to this week, I I checked this morning. I was checking last night before I I left the office. The New York Times estimates are supposed to come in this week. Oh. So unfortunate timing for a budget adoption. I think we should still move forward with it. Mhmm. We can always adjust at the start of the new fiscal year if needed. But, I don't think there's gonna be no changes. I made some slight recalibrations. We had some new invoices. We we get invoices at this time of year to apply to the next fiscal year for some of our databases and costs went up just a a tad bit in some areas. And so I made those recalibrations, but no major changes since you last saw the budget. I think this provides us with enough funds, ample funds to do continue to do the great program that we've been doing for both kids, adults, and teens. Some are reading included in that and, adequate funds for both ebooks and a balance with those and hard copy materials. Any questions about the budget or things that we didn't discuss last I think the budget is looking it over for what we're looking at with uncertainty, I think we're attacking it the right way because a lot of things are still very uncertain. Mhmm. But we should go forward with the New York Times Mhmm. Do that. And I think Mary Jo probably maybe even this fall, you're gonna have to go look at it, maybe in October meeting and just look at yourself where you stand. Mhmm. It's gonna be this year's gonna be a very fluid thing to bring the streams out. And with the economy Right. We don't know what's gonna happen. So I I think I'm all for the budget. I think it's very well put together, and it's the needs, the things we got rid of were dropped. It had to be with the present fiscal climate. And I think we've all discussed it very well. You people have been very, very involved with this. So any questions you guys the rest of you have about this? No question about this specifically, but as we did when we dropped Tupelo, are we we gonna how do we communicate Yes. The changes? Yes. So we already have a language and plan in place. In fact, a newsletter is going out tomorrow Okay. That talks about Hoopla sunsetting. We didn't have anywhere near near the usage of Hoopla did, so I can't imagine that it would be yeah. With Flipster. And the parks passes. Right. Mhmm. And parks passes, we thankfully have through the summer and the fall. Right. Those will sunset through in December. Okay. If they sunset. If they sun if they sunset and, you know, a new board could say we wanna fund this after all. So things could change. They're up in the air. But for the time being, the parks passes are fine. We don't really need to do any communications about those, until fall, and, Flipster Flipster will get the word out starting Okay. Yeah. Perfect. K. Good. Thank you. Because those passes are funded by California State Parks. Right. Yeah. Yeah. I the present situation, I don't think they're gonna fund it. I I would be surprised. But I really really would need to. Any other Susan, do you have anything to add to that? Alright. Then I guess we could, have a motion to adopt a budget. I so Alright. We adopt the budget. Seconded. Okay. Can I have a roll call now, please? Marie Claire Gorham. Yes. John Krisscher. Yes. Susan Murphy. No. Bill Pardue. Yes. Mary Jo Williams. Yes. It's unanimous. Thank you. Alright. Thank you very much. Alright. Let's move on to our last item here. We're gonna consider of 2 budget adjustments. $5,300 for from 83 0 0 0 author visit to 04/10/2000 future furniture for the children's bench seating reupholstery. And $215 from $6.06 100 to OCLC cataloging to 62 0 1 0 0 teen fiction and teen wonder books. So I typically don't do budget adjustments this late in the year. However, what I am projecting at this point because of the additional interest income, additional income from friends is that we are going to be, 1, under our our budget overall, but especially under with those numbers, and I feel comfortable doing this budget adjustment at the end of the year. Some of these things were requests for next fiscal year, that I realized that we could probably, because of the lower dollar amount, accommodate in this fiscal year's budget when I was doing my projections out, in March and April and tracking all of this. The children's bench seating reupholstery project, if you haven't been into the kids department, those benches are well used. They are not only a little grimy, which could do with some cleaning, but they're threadbare in in places. And so it's time for reupholstery. Those were originally, those are original to the building when it was renovated in 1989. So I'd say it's fair It's time. Fair after 30 or 40 years to reupholster those benches. We've gotten quotes, for those, and I think that we should move forward with that. The second item was a request from the teen librarian, for Wonder Books. We have been working very hard on recalibrating that collection. We have we don't have a teen audio collection. When we had at 1 point had teen audio and teen DVDs and those got incorporated into the adult collections. This is all pre pandemic, because they weren't getting used. But we've seen such great usage of wonder books with the kids of all ages. You know, we've got chapter books, we've got nonfiction books, we've got picture books, we've got all the kinds of you know, anything that you see in the kids department, we've got the audio visual version of it. And then for adults, you know, we have, you know, kind of an equivalent. We've got our large print collection and then we've got our audios. And so the teen librarian proposed trying that for, for our teen our teens whether that's and we talked about, you know, for for pleasure reading, for school, how does that fit in? And she's been talking with the high school librarian about potential for life for wonder books for that, you know, instead of cliff notes, Wikipedia, what if you could toggle between, you know, actually reading the book or listening to it depending on, you know, going back and forth. So we wanna try that out, to see how our teens will feel about that. We're also gonna be purchasing within the budget current budget we have now some, Spanish English graphic novels, which I'm excited to add to the collection for teens. When I we come back for our next regular meeting in June, I do wanna I will be bringing to the board a report out on where we are, at the end of the year. We still need to add funds and I didn't include this there. I wanted to focus just on the budget adjustment for the collections and the upholstery, but a better reckoning of where we are after summer reading spending has started to wind down. Collection spending, we've got in at least $21,000 of orders that have gone out, that aren't reflected yet here in what you're seeing, for, end of year spending for hard copy collections. But we need to do a transfer to rebalance the 6 month operating reserve. So that will that will be coming forward at the end of the fiscal year. And then again, working within the bounds of the financial policy to let the Carmel Public Library Foundation know, if our disbursement can be reduced so that they can hold on to those funds and earn interest income. K. Good. So but that's that's why that's not included. We will be doing that, either at the the June or July, depending. Any questions about these budget adjustments? No. So it's for this year? It's for this year. For this fiscal year. Not for next year. It's for this fiscal year. If you look at the upholstery in the children's library, it can't it can't wait. It's gotta be done now. It's they've showed it to me a couple times, and I'll have to admit it's it's not that pretty. So I think that's a great Yeah. Great thing we have to do right now. And it's the the upholstery that's in there, I'll point out from a logistical perspective in the kids department, it's fabric. It was Scotch guarded at some point, but, you know, the the more things that you have that can wipe down very easily with the Cheeto fingers and things like that, the better for everybody. Alright. Anybody else have any comments? Alright. I have a a motion then to make the budget adjustments. I assume I move that we make a, budget adjustment for this year. Alright. So we can get more books and upholstery done. Alright. Can I have a second? Second. Alright. Roll call, please. Reclaire Gorham. Yes. John Krisscher. Yes. Susan Murphy. Yes. Phil Pardue. Yes. Mary Jo Williams. Yes. Alright. I think that is it. Unanimous. Mhmm. Future agenda items? Future agenda items. Future agenda items. Future agenda items. Future was it gonna say future agenda items, but that's That's That's up to you 3 to figure out which 1 you're So my recommendation is is that the, on the next meeting have a, update for the the new members on where we stand on the, project to get the the, library, remodeled. So we went forward both, where we stand in negotiations, timelines, what you're doing, you know, you know, fairly in-depth, as you go forward. And then also, I recommend that the, Saturday hours. And that's the 1 thing that, was, that the community wanted. That was the 1 thing we didn't look at this year, which we probably should have. But, you know, for the, are we, do we have the manning? You know, what's the hold up? What needs to be done? Yeah. And what's the risk if we don't get to Saturday hours? Yeah. That's that's very good. I mean, I thought we had it made, you know, because the council gave us 4 part time employees, and I thought we were on the way last year with the budget. And all of a sudden, it just didn't go through. So that's a very that's everything I hear yet to this day day is we have to have Saturday hours. Mhmm. And that's so important to the community. And I just I can't understand why we don't, but, that's what it is, it is. So And the, just on the, going back to the first item, and make sure the foundation has an opportunity to, lay out their plans for the the fundraising, how it goes, because so much depends on them, and what they need out of the board going forward. Yes. That's and the board to work with them on the Right. With, the design inside in the community, make sure the community is really involved. That's gonna be quite a project. And as you work through this, the, foundation's responsible to their donors, the mayor, and the city council responsible to a wider Yeah. Range of constituents. The only people that are gonna look after specifically the patrons Yeah. Because it's your sole focus, is this board of trustees as you go forward. So it's gonna be a lot of pressures there Yes. As you go through, because everybody has their constituents that see they need to satisfy. Mhmm. But you're the only ones that are solely focused. I'm not saying the foundation isn't concerned about the patrons, but you do have donors. But the, Ford is the only 1 solely focused on the patrons. Very well said, Phil. Very well said. Anything else? So, yes, I actually do have, the, fiscal year '20 '3, '20 '4 audit report. We can either wait till the new fiscal year and I'll work with Mary Jo on that. As I've mentioned earlier, end of year report, potential of year report for June, and then election of officers. K. They wanna do the, audit, the second meeting, not the first meeting. You're gonna have a lot to go through. I don't know. But I'll leave that up to Mary Jo, of course. Yeah. Miss Mary Jo will handle it.

I think they're just so important to the community.\n\nAnd I wish the board a lot of luck because there's a lot of, cuts coming in the budget. And I hope you all fight together and just hold the library because it's very important to the community. And it's meant an awful lot to me over the 30 years, so I hope that the board just keeps pounding and make sure that the library keeps vibrant and going. And I'm sure with you in charge of it, you know, it'll be going that way, and you, MacLeod, and Susan. So thank you again.\n\nSpeaker 2: I think it's it's the board's work, but thank you. Thank\n\nSpeaker 4: you, Joe.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Thanks, Phil. Yeah. Alright. Let's move on to the approve the minutes from the April 23 regular meeting.\n\nAny changes to\n\nSpeaker 0: them? Make a motion to approve the April 23 minutes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Do I have a second?\n\nSpeaker 4: Go ahead. I second.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright. Let's have a roll call, please.\n\nSpeaker 3: Marie Claire Gorham. Yes. John Krisscher.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 3: Susan Murphy. Yes. Phil Pardue. Yes. Mary Jo Williams.\n\nYes. It is unanimous. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Now we received the librarian's report for April 25.\n\nSpeaker 4: Do we have\n\nSpeaker 2: to approve the special meeting minutes or\n\nSpeaker 3: yes. We do need to approve the special. I'm sorry. I'm gonna just we could have done them all as 1 budget. No.\n\nSpeaker 1: We did all as 1 on Monday. It's okay. Alright. We have a motion to\n\nSpeaker 0: Make a motion to approve the special meeting minutes.\n\nSpeaker 4: Seconded.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright. May I have a roll call, please?\n\nSpeaker 3: Marie Claire Gorham. Yes. John Krisscher.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 3: Susan Murphy. Yes. Phil Pardue. Yes. Mary Jo Williams.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes. Alright.\n\nSpeaker 3: Miss Hannemas.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now we'll move on to the librarians report. Thank you. That's okay.\n\nSpeaker 3: So for the librarians report, no big announcements there. Slight dip in adult circulation, bump up in kids' circulation. This is this was the month of Easter. So we saw travel people traveling during this month, and then we also saw kids off of school, so more kids in the library. So depending on your circumstances, you could have been out of town.\n\nSo it's it's we see these bump ups and downs whenever there's the holidays, or time off if there's, you know, fall break with kids, we see more foot traffic and things like that. Are there any questions about librarians report overall? No big anomalies there? Okay. That's it.\n\nOkay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright. Let's move on to the treasurer's report and check register.\n\nSpeaker 5: Just gonna say, in general, looking at this month as well that we would run lean. To my math, expenses came in 13% under budget, so that's, doing great. And, yeah, efficient spending. And, yeah, we're we're on on track to stay lean.\n\nSpeaker 1: Anybody?\n\nSpeaker 5: Yeah. Yeah. Any questions?\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright. Then we'll have a motion to approve the check register, please.\n\nSpeaker 0: For which month? Check check register for which month?\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, I think April. April. April '20 fifth.\n\nSpeaker 0: Make a motion to approve the, April, check register.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can I have a second, please?\n\nSpeaker 2: I second it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Roll call.\n\nSpeaker 3: Reclaire Gorham. Yes. John Krisscher.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 3: Susan Murphy. Yes. Phil Pardue.\n\nSpeaker 4: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 3: Mary Jo Williams. Yes. Deanna Miss. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 4: Alex, could we have\n\nSpeaker 1: the Public Library\n\nSpeaker 4: Foundation's, recent activities?\n\nSpeaker 1: Good morning, trustees. Good morning,\n\nSpeaker 6: Morning. So, at our last meeting, we approved our budget for 2526. We approved the slate of officers. We also approved 2 new board members, and we approved to move forward, and to release the funds for the Centennial Restoration Project for phase 1. Lot of approvals.\n\nAnd we're continuing to work on raising funds for the Centennial Restoration. We're working with the city to help finalize the architect agreement as well. And, we're also working on new programs for next year, including that's it. That's what I have so far. Any questions, though?\n\nNo.\n\nSpeaker 0: Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 4: Thank you. Alright.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright. We'll see a report from the library relocation ad hoc committee.\n\nSpeaker 3: So on behalf of the ad hoc committee, work continues apace. We have 3 potential locations, and we are still trying to get some of those details nailed down so that we can bring a full report to the board of trustees for further discussion. So that when we do start to move forward, with a renovation project, we have things planned out and situated for where library operations will, be held, for continuity of operations so that it's seamless. Any any additions to that, Mary Claire or Mary\n\nSpeaker 4: Jo? No?\n\nSpeaker 5: We've been doing our tours.\n\nSpeaker 3: Yes. Yes. Excited. Asking lots of questions. Yes.\n\nMaking more charts. Yes. On tour. Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: So we have 3 3 places\n\nSpeaker 4: right now.\n\nSpeaker 2: 3 places. Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. And which 1 will be Sunset Center is probably the best, you think?\n\nSpeaker 5: I think it's the remains our simplest solution, but it's still\n\nSpeaker 4: it's Yeah. We've we've the tail.\n\nSpeaker 3: We're so thankful details. We're so thankful that the community is, in some cases, has stepped forward when they heard about this project and said we're we would be interested in hosting you. So, the spaces that we're talking to people about and considering and asking questions are the Sunset Center, the Church of the Wayfarer, and the Carmel Youth Center. And again, grateful that, you know, when we when we first started this process, we weren't sure if we were gonna find a space in town, and now we have 3 to compare and contrast against. And 3 really great community partners that we work with.\n\nChurch of the Wayfarer used to host, the Friends of the Library author, Visit and Tea before the Carmel Public Library Foundation did this. So we we have these established relationships. Sunset Center obviously hosts a lot of the library programs and city meetings. And then Carmel Youth Center, we have partnered with them on children's programs before. So all of these make good sense and, we're gonna continue our studies\n\nSpeaker 4: as we go forward.\n\nSpeaker 0: So if you all, if you all have a, earliest possible move date in mind so you can start working? Because I mean, I know it's fluid right now, but if everything goes well, what would be the earliest date that you think you'd, need to move in, or you plan it for?\n\nSpeaker 3: So based on, based on I mean, the the goal ultimate goal is to complete a renovation in 2028. So working backwards from that date and time, probably mid 20 26 or fall of 20 26 would be when we'd wanna move in because we still need to go through the design process Mhmm. With the architect and we still need to go out to bid, for a contractor. And the the bidding process alone takes, you know, between 3 and 6 months depending. So we've got some time ahead of us and that's something that we have communicated with the free spaces is that that while we're doing this now, to be ahead of the game and, again, ensure continuity of operations, we're still a bit a bit of a ways off at least a year out from potential occupation of another space.\n\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Plenty of time.\n\nSpeaker 3: Plenty of time, but we like to do our due diligence. And that that plenty of time though will go quickly. It will go very quickly, to ask these questions and to make sure that if there's programs happening in spaces that we found alternate locations or solutions for accommodating those types of things going on within a library space, which makes sense in a lot of cases. Having the equipment we need, shelves, all of that. So it will it will be vast.\n\nSpeaker 0: Right. Once you get the architectural contract done, you'll have a better idea of which 1 will be.\n\nSpeaker 3: Exactly. Right. But but right now, we're telling, the people that we're talking to, you're a year and a half out.\n\nSpeaker 1: Got it.\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, John, you commissioned us to start working on this almost a year ago, recognizing that it's gonna be\n\nSpeaker 3: 1 of the very first questions. Right?\n\nSpeaker 2: What's gonna happen to the library operations when all this is happening? And we need to have a pretty cogent answer. Sooner versus later. But it is hard they're all great spaces. They all have some great, benefits, but they all have some drawbacks.\n\nSo it's, you know, I think and it's just trying to figure out\n\nSpeaker 3: Right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Which which is really the most viable.\n\nSpeaker 4: Yeah. Which Right.\n\nSpeaker 3: And as and as John, you know, again, getting this started earlier Yeah. Rather than later, the wounds of having the library closed for, you know, during the pandemic are still there. And nobody wants to see the library shut down again. Right. And so we wanna keep operations going,\n\nSpeaker 4: in a different location.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know, I would love to\n\nSpeaker 4: see us be closed for, you\n\nSpeaker 3: know, only a week in between, because we're so well organized, we can just open right back up again.\n\nSpeaker 4: That's\n\nSpeaker 3: Keep things going. Yeah. So\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright. We'll move on then. Okay. Let's adopt a 20 20 25, 20 27 Sysico plan, which I reading it, a lot of work went into it. And I appreciate everybody that served on it.\n\nOkay. It's been I think I've did a quite a fantastic job.\n\nSpeaker 3: Thank you for that, president Krisscher. We didn't receive any major feedback from the public. I had a few grammatical things here and there, formatting things, switch this around, which those were incorporated into the strategic plan, but nothing. And I think we saw this, when we did our 2 community outreach meetings last spring at this time where we saw low attendance and participation partly because mainly the people the the things that people wanna see are Saturday hours and then that list of programs that fit in within our objectives. And so, again, we'll continue to do what we do.\n\nI think our staff does very well is listen to the public on a day to daily basis so that we can recalibrate our operations. But I feel very proud of the work that went into this plan. We had a very dynamic group of strategic planners. I appreciate all of the work that the trustees put into going through this line by line at the last special meeting. And this is something I'd like I think would be great, especially with the just uncertainty, especially with economics and state library.\n\nWe talked about with our financial policy, doing more in-depth quarterly budget reviews, especially if we wanna pull back on, amount of money needed from the disbursement from CPLF to also be doing quarterly reviews rather than, semiannual reviews of the strategic plan. And I have started a strategic plan. And I have started a work plan for the staff, for, you know, year 2025 to assign, out objectives and to start talking to everybody about that once this is adopted. And that's a plan I can I I talked to I spoke about last month about bringing back to the board of trustees so you can see what that looks like? Yeah.\n\nYeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: So we, went through it. I guess, we made a couple recommended changes, like, it went to the mission statement. I don't know if there's anything else through there. Those changes have been made.\n\nSpeaker 3: No others All of those changes have been made. Before. Mhmm. Exactly.\n\nSpeaker 4: Any other\n\nSpeaker 3: questions or thoughts about it? No. No.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's it's a good plan. Mhmm.\n\nSpeaker 3: I feel I feel good about it. I feel like it's a solid plan that we can really make some headway on over the next few years.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes. You had community input, which has really helped that way.\n\nSpeaker 4: I did. So it's\n\nSpeaker 1: out there. Mhmm. Alright. So we have to have a a motion on that or anything?\n\nSpeaker 3: Yes. Please.\n\nSpeaker 4: Have a\n\nSpeaker 1: motion to adopt the plan? Make a\n\nSpeaker 0: motion to adopt the, the 2025 strategic plan for the library.\n\nSpeaker 1: Do I have a second?\n\nSpeaker 4: I'll I'll second that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Can I have a roll call, please?\n\nSpeaker 4: Mary Jo and I\n\nSpeaker 3: have Marie Claire Gordon. Yes. John Krisscher.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 3: Susan Murphy. Yes. Phil Pardew.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 3: Mary Jo Williams. Yes. Wonderful. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright. Thank you very much. Now we move on to the next of the adopt the fiscal year budget for 20 25, 20 26. Which any comments from anybody on this before, Ashley?\n\nSpeaker 3: So, we went through the budget for, over the last 2 meetings, the last regular meeting and then the special meeting that we had last month. I have made those recalibrations as we discussed with Flipster, parks passes, elimination of that service. I still I'm supposed to this week, I I checked this morning. I was checking last night before I I left the office. The New York Times estimates are supposed to come in this week.\n\nOh. So unfortunate timing for a budget adoption. I think we should still move forward with it. Mhmm. We can always adjust at the start of the new fiscal year if needed.\n\nBut, I don't think there's gonna be no changes. I made some slight recalibrations. We had some new invoices. We we get invoices at this time of year to apply to the next fiscal year for some of our databases and costs went up just a a tad bit in some areas. And so I made those recalibrations, but no major changes since you last saw the budget.\n\nI think this provides us with enough funds, ample funds to do continue to do the great program that we've been doing for both kids, adults, and teens. Some are reading included in that and, adequate funds for both ebooks and a balance with those and hard copy materials. Any questions about the budget or things that we didn't discuss last\n\nSpeaker 1: I think the budget is looking it over for what we're looking at with uncertainty, I think we're attacking it the right way because a lot of things are still very uncertain.\n\nSpeaker 0: Mhmm.\n\nSpeaker 1: But we should go forward with the New York Times Mhmm. Do that. And I think Mary Jo probably maybe even this fall, you're gonna have to go look at it, maybe in October meeting and just look at yourself where you stand.\n\nSpeaker 4: Mhmm.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's gonna be this year's gonna be a very fluid thing to bring the streams out. And with the economy\n\nSpeaker 4: Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: We don't know what's gonna happen. So I I think I'm all for the budget. I think it's very well put together, and it's the needs, the things we got rid of were dropped. It had to be with the present fiscal climate. And I think we've all discussed it very well.\n\nYou people have been very, very involved with this. So any questions you guys the rest of you have about this?\n\nSpeaker 2: No question about this specifically, but as we did when we dropped Tupelo, are we we gonna how do we communicate\n\nSpeaker 4: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: The changes?\n\nSpeaker 3: Yes. So we already have a language and plan in place. In fact, a newsletter is going out tomorrow Okay. That talks about Hoopla sunsetting. We didn't have anywhere near\n\nSpeaker 4: near the usage of Hoopla did, so I\n\nSpeaker 3: can't imagine that\n\nSpeaker 4: it would be yeah.\n\nSpeaker 3: With Flipster. And the parks passes. Right. Mhmm. And parks passes, we thankfully have through the summer and the fall.\n\nRight. Those will sunset through in December. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 0: If they sunset.\n\nSpeaker 3: If they sun if they sunset and, you know, a new board could say we wanna fund this after all. So things could change. They're up in the air. But for the time being, the parks passes are fine. We don't really need to do any communications about those, until fall, and, Flipster\n\nSpeaker 4: Flipster will get the word out starting Okay. Yeah. Perfect.\n\nSpeaker 1: K.\n\nSpeaker 4: Good. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 0: Because those passes are funded by California State Parks.\n\nSpeaker 3: Right. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. I the present situation, I don't think they're gonna fund it.\n\nSpeaker 2: I I would be surprised.\n\nSpeaker 4: But\n\nSpeaker 1: I really really would need to. Any other Susan,\n\nSpeaker 4: do you have anything to add to that?\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright. Then I guess we could, have a motion to adopt a budget.\n\nSpeaker 4: I so Alright. We adopt the budget. Seconded.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Can I have a roll call now, please?\n\nSpeaker 3: Marie Claire Gorham. Yes. John Krisscher.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 3: Susan Murphy. No. Bill Pardue. Yes. Mary Jo Williams.\n\nYes. It's unanimous. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright. Thank you very much. Alright. Let's move on to our last item here. We're gonna consider of 2 budget adjustments.\n\n$5,300 for from 83 0 0 0 author visit to 04/10/2000 future furniture for the children's bench seating reupholstery. And $215 from $6.06 100 to OCLC cataloging to 62 0 1 0 0 teen fiction and teen wonder books.\n\nSpeaker 3: So I typically don't do budget adjustments this late in the year. However, what I am projecting at this point because of the additional interest income, additional income from friends is that we are going to be, 1, under our our budget overall, but especially under with those numbers, and I feel comfortable doing this budget adjustment at the end of the year. Some of these things were requests for next fiscal year, that I realized that we could probably, because of the lower dollar amount, accommodate in this fiscal year's budget when I was doing my projections out, in March and April and tracking all of this. The children's bench seating reupholstery project, if you haven't been into the kids department, those benches are well used. They are not only a little grimy, which could do with some cleaning, but they're threadbare in in places.\n\nAnd so it's time for reupholstery. Those were originally, those are original to the building when it was renovated in 1989. So I'd say it's fair It's time. Fair after 30 or 40 years to reupholster those benches. We've gotten quotes, for those, and I think that we should move forward with that.\n\nThe second item was a request from the teen librarian, for Wonder Books. We have been working very hard on recalibrating that collection. We have we don't have a teen audio collection. When we had at 1 point had teen audio and teen DVDs and those got incorporated into the adult collections. This is all pre pandemic, because they weren't getting used.\n\nBut we've seen such great usage of wonder books with the kids of all ages. You know, we've got chapter books, we've got nonfiction books, we've got picture books, we've got all the kinds of you know, anything that you see in the kids department, we've got the audio visual version of it. And then for adults, you know, we have, you know, kind of an equivalent. We've got our large print collection and then we've got our audios. And so the teen librarian proposed trying that for, for our teen our teens whether that's and we talked about, you know, for for pleasure reading, for school, how does that fit in?\n\nAnd she's been talking with the high school librarian about potential for life for wonder books for that, you know, instead of cliff notes, Wikipedia, what if you could toggle between, you know, actually reading the book or listening to it depending on, you know, going back and forth. So we wanna try that out, to see how our teens will feel about that. We're also gonna be purchasing within the budget current budget we have now some, Spanish English graphic novels, which I'm excited to add to the collection for teens. When I we come back for our next regular meeting in June, I do wanna I will be bringing to the board a report out on where we are, at the end of the year. We still need to add funds and I didn't include this there.\n\nI wanted to focus just on the budget adjustment for the collections and the upholstery, but a better reckoning of where we are after summer reading spending has started to wind down. Collection spending, we've got in at least $21,000 of orders that have gone out, that aren't reflected yet here in what you're seeing, for, end of year spending for hard copy collections. But we need to do a transfer to rebalance the 6 month operating reserve. So that will that will be coming forward at the end of the fiscal year. And then again, working within the bounds of the financial policy to let the Carmel Public Library Foundation know, if our disbursement can be reduced so that they can hold on to those funds and earn interest income.\n\nK. Good. So but that's that's why that's not included. We will be doing that, either at the the June or July, depending. Any questions about these budget adjustments?\n\nSpeaker 4: No. So it's for this year?\n\nSpeaker 3: It's for this year. For this fiscal year. Not for next year. It's for this fiscal year.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you look at the upholstery in the children's library, it can't it can't wait. It's gotta be done now. It's they've showed it to me a couple times, and I'll have to admit it's it's not that pretty. So I think that's a great Yeah. Great thing we have to do right now.\n\nSpeaker 3: And it's the the upholstery that's in there, I'll point out from a logistical perspective in the kids department, it's fabric. It was Scotch guarded at some point, but, you know, the the more things that you have that can wipe down very easily with the Cheeto fingers and things like that, the better for everybody.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright. Anybody else have any comments? Alright. I have a a motion then to make the budget adjustments.\n\nSpeaker 4: I assume I move that we make a, budget adjustment for this year. Alright. So we can get more books and upholstery done. Alright.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can I have a second?\n\nSpeaker 4: Second.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright. Roll call,\n\nSpeaker 3: please. Reclaire Gorham. Yes. John Krisscher.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 3: Susan Murphy. Yes. Phil Pardue.\n\nSpeaker 4: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 3: Mary Jo Williams. Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright. I think that is\n\nSpeaker 3: it. Unanimous.\n\nSpeaker 0: Mhmm. Future agenda items?\n\nSpeaker 4: Future agenda items.\n\nSpeaker 6: Future agenda items.\n\nSpeaker 3: Future agenda items.\n\nSpeaker 1: Future was it gonna say future agenda items, but that's That's That's up to you 3 to figure out which 1 you're\n\nSpeaker 0: So my recommendation is is that the, on the next meeting have a, update for the the new members on where we stand on the, project to get the the, library, remodeled. So we went forward both, where we stand in negotiations, timelines, what you're doing, you know, you know, fairly in-depth, as you go forward. And then also, I recommend that the, Saturday hours. And that's the 1 thing that, was, that the community wanted. That was the 1 thing we didn't look at this year, which we probably should have.\n\nBut, you know, for the, are we, do we have the manning? You know, what's the hold up? What needs to be done? Yeah. And what's the risk if we don't get to Saturday hours?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. That's that's very good. I mean, I thought we had it made, you know, because the council gave us 4 part time employees, and I thought we were on the way last year with the budget. And all of a sudden, it just didn't go through. So that's a very that's everything I hear yet to this day day is we have to have Saturday hours.\n\nSpeaker 4: Mhmm.\n\nSpeaker 1: And that's so important to the community. And I just I can't understand why we don't, but, that's what it is, it is.\n\nSpeaker 0: So And the, just on the, going back to the first item, and make sure the foundation has an opportunity to, lay out their plans for the the fundraising, how it goes, because so much depends on them, and what they need out of the board going forward.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes. That's and the board to work with them\n\nSpeaker 0: on the Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: With, the design inside in the community, make sure the community is really involved. That's gonna be quite a project.\n\nSpeaker 0: And as you work through this, the, foundation's responsible to their donors, the mayor, and the city council responsible to a wider Yeah. Range of constituents. The only people that are gonna look after specifically the patrons Yeah. Because it's your sole focus, is this board of trustees as you go forward. So it's gonna be a lot of pressures there\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 0: As you go through, because everybody has their constituents that see they need to satisfy. Mhmm. But you're the only ones that are solely focused. I'm not saying the foundation isn't concerned about the patrons, but you do have donors. But the, Ford is the only 1 solely focused on the patrons.\n\nSpeaker 1: Very well said, Phil. Very well said. Anything else?\n\nSpeaker 3: So, yes, I actually do have, the, fiscal year '20 '3, '20 '4 audit report. We can either wait till the new fiscal year and I'll work with Mary Jo on that. As I've mentioned earlier, end of year report, potential of year report for June, and then election of officers.\n\nSpeaker 1: K.\n\nSpeaker 0: They wanna do the, audit, the second meeting, not the first meeting. You're gonna have a lot to go through.\n\nSpeaker 3: I don't know.\n\nSpeaker 4: But I'll\n\nSpeaker 0: leave that up to Mary Jo, of course. Yeah. Miss\n\nSpeaker 1: Mary Jo will handle it.\n\nSpeaker 3: We're we're getting used to\n\nSpeaker 2: the The board will handle it.\n\nSpeaker 3: 4 hour meetings. Yes. We will I will I will work with Mary Jo. Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright. Anything else? Alright. Yes. Meeting adjourned.\n\nSpeaker 3: Thank you all.","paragraphs":[{"sentences":[{"text":"Afterwards with a, you know, congratulations party and a baby shower for
