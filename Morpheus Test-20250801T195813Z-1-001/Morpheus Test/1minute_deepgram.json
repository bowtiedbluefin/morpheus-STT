Today, we're in a commemorative for Cesar Chavez here in Cesar Chavez Park. Today, we stand next to the Cesar Chavez commemorative that celebrates the life and contributions of Chavez. The little plaza symbolizes the agricultural fields where Chavez spent most of his life working the land and fighting for the rights of the field laborers. 4 large blacks depict different aspects of Chavez's life as a leader of the United Farm Workers Union. Everything in the plaza has a significance from the rows of trees and desert plants to the dry river wash celebrating the irrigation system that produces food. The bronze statue of Cesar Chavez faces the mountains and fields south of Cesar Chavez Park. The Cesar Chavez commemorative was created by Sarco Guerrero, Martin Moreno and Dalinda Jimenez Madrid in 1998 for the Phoenix Arts Commission of the city of
