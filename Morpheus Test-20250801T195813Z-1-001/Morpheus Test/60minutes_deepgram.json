It takes a simple majority of voting members to pass a motion. May I take a moment to introduce people? I'm Elizabeth Brown. I'm chairman of the board, Katie Williams. To my here is vice chair, Kalia Bell, John Hayden, Jake Johnson, and Hillary Morgan. Thank you. Alright. Warren Adams, Sean Rose, David Babb, and Nikhil Rose. Thank you. Thank you. The first, project tonight is a fence in Capitol Heights, 125 North Lewis Street, Gloria Williams. Thank you. Tell us about your fence. Yes. Miss Elizabeth, what did you just say? I said tell us about your fence. About my what? Is it a fence? Oh, I'm old, baby. That's alright. Me too. Old lady, but that's okay. Alright. And I got somebody here if I don't understand something. Okay? How y'all doing this evening? We're fine. Y'all look good. So I hope y'all give me an approval. But, anyway, let me tell you about the fence. If you look at the property on the screen well, don't go for that because that's that's bad. Okay. Right there on the screen, that fence, when I bought that house in 2022, had a left fence that adjoined to the house that go all the way over to the end of the property line. What I did was, I have a brand new air conditioning unit that cost me almost $10,000, and I'm paying through Spectrum. I mean, I owe them too. But anyway, Duke I mean, the power company, Alabama Power. I'm from Charlotte, North Carolina, so I don't know the Alabama rules too good, but I'm learning them real fast. Okay. So that fence that you see over there, what I did was to try to protect my my air condition unit. My neighbor told me, miss Carol next door, she say, you need to cover your air condition unit because she say, somebody might try to steal it and steal your copper because they can just walk straight in. So what I did was I built like a l shape. So at the end of that fence, I came in about 3 feet and then went down 20 feet, went over 15 feet and made a fence so nobody couldn't take my union. But then I thought they might can cut it. So I just put a little cover around it so they wouldn't see the fence on the side and in the back. And when you're standing at the end of the street, which is, not that good. Wilona. Yes. Because I'm at the corner of Wilona And Lewis. When you stand at the end of my driveway, which is on Wilona, you can't even see my fence because I only went back, not at the end of the house, kinda in the middle. And then also that that line up to make that veil went up 20 feet, and it can't be seen. And I didn't know that I needed to do all of this, what I'm doing now, but I know now from mister Sean, who was very nice to me. Mister Sean Rose, that is. But I'm asking because the people that put it up finished it, even though I asked them to stop. I had finished it when I got back home from the hospital. And so, mister Sean Rose told me I still need to get an approval, because I was supposed to get that at first. Me not being from here, from Charlotte, North Carolina, you know, I'm no 1. I know now. And I just ask that all of you, miss Cahill, mister Jake Johnson, miss Elizabeth Brown, miss Katie Williams, miss Hillary Morgan, and mister John Hayden, that y'all would give me an approval to protect my air conditioning unit. I might look young, but I'm 65. So I'm a old lady, and I live by myself, and I need an approval. And I know from now on, mister Sean told me always get a approval before something is done, but I know. So that's what I'm asking for tonight, and I appreciate you guys. Is there anyone in the audience to speak to this project? Ma'am? I'm I'm asking if there's anybody in the audience in your neighborhood that wants to talk about this project. I don't see anybody. What'd you say, babe? You're fine. You're fine. You're fine. I can't hardly hear or see the bifocals. Yeah. Miss Williams, she she's asking if anyone in the audience, wants to speak on on the project. I got I got a lady here to help me understand your ruling, but let's don't bring her up and see if I could try to help myself. I wanna try to help myself to stay where before I I don't wanna get dementia and stuff too bad. But mister Sean did tell me to bring somebody, and I bought a nice lady back there. She's a lady that I met since I've been here. I don't have no family. All my family did. Mama, daddy's 2 sisters. I got 1 daughter that lives in New York. She's a lawyer. She said, mama, make sure you obey all the rules. You got to find out before you do stuff, because I was crying about this. And she say yeah. And she say, but, mama, you got to find out. I say, okay. They explained to me, but she's here in case I don't understand something y'all tell me today. Thank thank you. But she'll be here. I ain't trying to shoot no missiles or nothing. I just wanna get approval for my friend. I got a missile. Like like the war has started doing. I lehi to have fun, and mama say, you talk too much, Gloria. Be quiet. But that's all I got. I would like to I enjoy I I just can I get everybody for mister John? Woah. Woah. Woah. Mister John, you're not smiling. I am a Smile because I'm a good person. Many missiles fired in this world. Well, look. I'm just saying. I ain't asking for much. I ain't asking for y'all to back me up trying to protect the neighborhood or nothing. I just want to be able to protect my activist. Miss Williams, I wanna I'm trying to get you, get you back to your seat. Oh, you ready for me to go? Yeah. Well, I don't joke. I don't have let me just say this before I go. I don't have no family here. My mom will pass. My daddy pass. No family. But that's why I wanna talk because I ain't got nobody to talk to. No. No. You're fine. You're fine. Alright, miss Vail. I'm gone. Yeah. I wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Stay right there. Stay right there. Stay right there. What do you want me to do now? I want you to stay right there. Okay. Just stop talking. Yes. Okay. I move to approve as submitted. Second. All in favor? Hey. I have 1. Alright. Alright. God bless all of y'all, and I thank you from the bottom of my heart. And, mister Sean, thank you for explaining stuff to me. I appreciate it. And enjoy your lovely house. Good. Your lovely air. Okay. I really enjoyed y'all. I really don't wanna leave, but that's okay. I'll go home. She gonna drop me off, and then I'm by myself again. Okay. Alright. Now we need to appoint a committee to go and visit. Yeah. Why can't why can't every presenter be nice to come Hey. I'm sorry you missed that. I'm sorry. I am all here. Need to watch the re swag. K. Number 2. We're on number 2. Jean Mahan. Number 2, Howard Street. Gina has been set with entertainment value I I don't think I can compete. I'll give you a dollar if you can. Yeah. I guess, the the what I'm hearing about is something that we got approved by the ARB last year. And, due to some timing and some other projects, I didn't get time to go get the variance. And now I'm back in front of you since you are all now doing the variances. So I'm asking for what we all agreed to last year, you know, pretty simply. I I guess when we approved the fence that the variances were still going through, which was it Warren? Who who handled? That would have been Board of Adjustment. And so since we approved Board of Adjustment, we now have the authority to grama variances and Yes. Okeydoke. That's what I thought. Make Yeah. I I was kinda surprised too. And I understand sometimes you get approval. I've done it myself where you don't start immediately and then something happens. But Yeah. And this was subject to, like, our neighbors had some comments that we acceded to. So, I think everybody was in agreement with the it was Okay. So this will be your name for this 1. Since we approved before. Yes. Alright. Warren, is there any particular language that needs to be in the motion to make the variance? Really just that you approve a 3 foot height variance and a 30 foot setback variance. I What? Wait. I I didn't quite hear that. You're requesting a 3 foot height variance Yes. And a 30 foot setback variance. Correct. The the main thing at issue was that in order to keep the fence level for the length, the ground drops off. And so we Yeah. We would bring in some fill dirt to build up Remember all? Height of the dirt at the end so that the fence would be at, a, continuous height. Yeah. Yeah. I think I remember we talked about that last time, didn't we? Yes. Yes. I think yeah. That's what the neighbors were mostly. Yeah. And I don't think yeah. That's what that was not a problem. Yeah. Okay. Is there anyone in the audience to speak to this project? Does anyone on the board have further comments? No. I move to approve the request of the 3 foot high variance and the 30 foot setback variance to be installed on the side yard property line as previously approved by the board. Second. Any all in favor? Opposed? Alright. You may go. Thank you. Thank you. Be happy. I didn't try to annotate. Candice Frasier from Church of the Ascension Garden District. Well, now I'm sorry she's sending you 2 up because Candice would have jokes. She's been a bit start by clarifying that neither of us are Candice Frazier. You're not in high heels, so I know you're not. Yeah. That's right. So I am Daniel Hughes, and this is Richard Norris. We are both members of Church of the Ascension and on the vestry. And we're here today to report back to him after the most recent meeting where, the church was requested to get, a structural little bit of a passion myself for historical redevelopment and have had the pleasure of working with, Gordon, our engineer that we engaged for about 32 years now. We've managed to save a few, but sometimes they're just so far gone that there's just nothing you can do. And that's really the bottom line here. We'd like to talk a little bit about what the church's hopes and plans are here. Richard can speak to them. But, I would first ask if there's any questions about the report. We've heard we've heard this before. Right? The Yeah. This is what came up last time, and I don't if I can remember correctly and or correct me if I'm wrong. I don't think we had an issue with what was actually presented. The concern was just the fact that we didn't have a structural report Right. Back up the demolition for the board. So in my opinion, that has been provided. I read based on the way that the report read for everybody, basically, the structure would basically have to be demolished and brought back up. So Well, it indicates the floor and the roof and the side. Everything would have to be replaced according to mister Davis, who I happen to have used years ago when I bought my house to get a report. So, basically, what you're saying is you gotta rebuild the house. That's that's but I I But I believe it. And I guarantee, I mean, I haven't looked personally, but I'm sure, you know, the structure itself with the wiring and other interior You know, you you'd have to rebuild the house. Well, the church has just recently bought this. Right. The church did not only Alright. Is there anyone in the audience to speak to this project? That's that's fine Christina Cadden, GDP a president. Who's now I think I'll just take a minute. Can you Yeah. Can you I think it's on now. Okay. Hi. Christina Cadden, GDP a president. Typically, we would strenuously oppose any demolition in the Garden District. But, we have just discussed with the Church of the Ascension, and we do think that it is appropriate, especially because you guys provided the structural or the report that you guys provided that states that the house would basically need to be entirely redone, and it would help with a lot of issues that they'll be having right there. So we do support it. Okay. Alright. Questions or comments from the board? I move to approve and submit it. Second. All in favor? No. Opposed? And thank you. Thank you all. Stallings and Sons about the remainder of the building at 39 North Perry Street. Thank you. I'm Rick Stallings, Stallings and Sons general contractors, and we've got a demolition application in with the city to remove the remaining wall that's standing, on 39 North Perry, the old Weber building. And I forwarded some drawings from structural engineer Gordon Davis showing where it proposed to either demolition, take it down, or marry it up with the wheel building wall. And that building is owned by the city, and they elected to not proceed with marrying it up and said they wanted the wall removed. And, also sent you some pictures of it also. Okay. Are there any comments from the audience about this project? Comments from the board. Mister Stallings, when the if you remove the this wall, what what is your site plan? What is what what do you intend for this particular, lot, I guess, once you remove the wall? Well, there's been some discussion to, to fill in the basement and and use it as a playground for a value across school. And there's all and or discussion to build a new structure there. Warren, may I ask what are the if something is new to be if something new is going to be done on this site, what sort of development requirements will the city have for the development of the project? Will it come back to the architecture review board for design review? Yes. Anything that goes there will have to come back to you. The the site is actually still designated. So so it will have to come back to you. Okay. And and just my own edification, when you have a single structure designation like this, it's actually the property, not the building itself that is historic. It's the 1. Yes. The site. So anything that goes on the property, you understand, mister Stallings, if you decide to put a playground or another building, you would have to submit plans to the board, for approval prior to deconstruction. Yes, sir. Okay. So it it's my understanding that we're supposed to give, whether or not it should be demolished, even though it was a landmark. I mean, the building's gone. I mean, it it is demolished. So what we're talking about is a wall. I in my opinion, I think that we allow the demolition, but it's not for us to say how it's being done. The structural analysis and all that would have to go through the city building department. And that's not part of us. I'm sure you submitted to the building department for what you plan to do to get a permit and things like that. Correct. The the the city's position at the moment is that, the city would like to get a structural engineer to look at this before anything is demolished. There were a couple of issues with the with the application. It appears the drawing is dated in 02/2018. So the drawing is actually out of date and the city is in the process of bringing in a structural engineer to actually look at it because the city now owns the building next door, and this wall has been exposed for for many years. And so I believe the city wants to be prudent and have a structural engineer look at it before any any demolition takes place. And I agree with that, but I don't know if that's our place to say. I think that's where when you get a city permit, they request that not for us to stay here because we don't look at structural anything really. We look at the structural integrity product like the other building. With all with all due respect, you just structural report for a demolition. Yeah. And it is also, just for clarity, typically in or it is ARB policy to require site plans when we are approving a demolition of a main structure. This is a little bit of an odd situation where there's only a brick wall remaining. But normally, we would ask, like, if if they were asking to demolish a main building, we would ask for site plans, for whatever be what is to be developed there. So that is another consideration. Warren, does the city intend to I mean, I don't wanna put too much on mister Stallings. Is the city prepared to pay a structural engineer, someone like mister Davis, perhaps, to come in and look at it? And and, I mean, quickly, I mean, if if something's held up, we're kinda holding mister Stallings property. Yeah. From what he might do in the future, and I don't wanna do that. What do you know when the city We we've been informed that the city is in the process of acquiring an updated structural evaluation of the wall and the potential impact of its removal on the adjacent city owned building. And the concern is obviously that this has been exposed to the elements for some time and this actually only come up after the application had been submitted and it traveled further up the chain. And so there appears to be some concern from the city engineering department about what the impact could be on the adjacent building. Because we need to know if the exposed wall has to be sealed, if the exposed wall requires repairs, if water's penetrated through the exposed wall. And we're really taking our cues from the the building and the engineering department as to the potential damage that could have been caused over the years to the to the wall of the city building. I think when we talked about the last job, for instance, okay, at the church, for me, that's a full building. It's a full structure. Nothing happened. Okay? That when we're looking at a full structure in its entirety, that's where I can say, hey, I think we wanna structure a report to support that. In a situation like this though, where we're looking at the wall. Okay? The rest of the building clearly isn't there. Okay? The basement, to me, is an open condition that's surrounded and can maintain a completely different thought process, in my opinion, in terms of safety related around that basement and in the condition that it's at. Okay? So I think that for us, on the board, my opinion is that they have a right to come. I'm in agreement with the removal of the wall. Okay? And the infill of the basement, right, to create a standard ground covering. I think that the conversation related around needing a structural engineer to look at it, I think that's fine and I can understand that point, but I think that really falls on the city. And the city permit department, which you have to have the permit in order to do the demolition. So I think ultimately for for me, unless I'm hearing otherwise, we as a board, they're coming to us asking for, can we do the project? I think the answer for myself is yes. Right? I support the removal of this wall and the infill of this location, Especially knowing that anything that's gonna be built there then has to come back to us for design review. But I think the removal of it then goes to the city for the per for the approval of the permit. And if they ask at that at that time that, hey. I'm on a structural, then that's the right of the city, but that's not necessarily the board. Yes. I I agree with what Hillary is saying. I think my biggest concern is in the event that any demolition occurs before the structural analysis is performed, we risk losing another building. We've lost 1 already, and I don't want to lose the building that the city's purchased because the wall it's not a party wall, but it's been probably leaning on this existing wall for many, many years. I don't know what this building dates back to. My biggest concern is if demolition occurs without the due diligence, then losing a second building on this block that would just further degrade the downtown fabric. But is the due diligence our I don't see I'm not saying that it is. But I'm saying Or I think any any motion has to have the stipulation. It seems to me like the city would just deny them approval to do the actual demolition, deny the permit, you know, until they they create those what they want. I just feel like it's kinda this is, like, out of order. Like, we really just should be looking at what it is that you propose to put there, not necessarily anything to do with the demolition. Because like everybody's already said, the building's gone. So there's nothing for us to really speak to. But coming back to us and letting us know what you wanna do, that is where our approval would be necessary. I think the way I hear y'all, I think for me, Jake, is if the and, Kalia, if the thing is, hey, we approve, the removal of the wall, okay, in the infill, as noted, okay, With the stipulation that the city approves the permit for the removal of the wall. I think that ultimately So upon their approval, we do approve as well. Correct. Lehi me make sure I'm also getting correct in my mind. The city is concerned removal of this wall could affect have some adverse effect on the building that the city is purchased. Is that is that what what they're worried about? Yes. Yes. Which potentially could be eligible to be designated historic as well, and this is also the national register district. So you know there are concerns that, we we would want to know exactly what the condition of that wall is on the city building before anything is done because that wall has been exposed. These drawings date to 02/2018. Right. So it's been exposed at least since then to the elements, to to water, and the city is in the process of getting an engine a structural engineer's report to see exactly Well, the city, even if we if we were to approve the demolition, the city with mister Stallings requests, because you're gonna have to have a permit, correct, to take this ball down. Yes. Couldn't the city just say, wait a minute. We're going through some we're having it evaluated. We're not gonna issue it yet. It's gonna we'll issue it subject to an adverse report or however they wanted to phrase it by by by the, structural engineer. Just to put this in a historical context, we approved the the work that was going to go on in this building that actually caused the building to fall down. So I think that but it's not our purview to to to, you know, do engineering or or structure review. That's the city building department. It's not our not our department. So I think we should just worry about whether or not this remnant of the historic building can be taken down. Have they given you a permit already? I'm sorry. Do you have a permit yet? A building permit may not be issued unless the ARB provides a certificate of appropriateness. Now now if a COA is issued, is granted, then, yes, a building permit or demolition permit will also be needed. So what we could say is we approve it pending that the city, does their due diligence on the structure. Well, we didn't approve it for this for the architect to do the due diligence on the building before it collapsed. That's not our point of view. That's true. We're we're counting on the city and the architects and engineers to do their jobs, and sometimes things happen. Let me share this with you if you will, please. If you look at the structural engineer drawing that Gordon Davis prepared that I presented to you Mhmm. This on there. There was 2 proposals. 1 to marry up and connect these 2 walls. And the other 1 was to take the Weber Building wall down. Now there is a airspace in between these 2 existing walls. And if you and if you look, it's braced off at this time. When mayor Bridal was in office, We did a project for the city to remove the roof, put new trusses and a new roof on this building. And those braces will remain in place at the at the request of the structural engineer, Gordon Davis. Now that mortar is lime based mortar and which is no longer in existence, and you can take your finger and dig it out. That's the reason that wall is still braced. If it wasn't, it'd come down on its own. I'd be honest with you. My concern is is is hazard. I mean, that if it were to come down and somebody in the area As the city's purview, we really don't have the expertise on this board to do that. And I think we just need to approve the demolition or not approve the demolition. That's our purview. Do we approve or disapprove pending? Can we do that pending? What It's not our job. I I I just look. It's not our job. I don't I I agree. I I don't think it's our job. Our job is to say, give you the permission to take it down or permission not to take it down. And we would have to state a specific reason for not taking it down. And right now, I can't think of 1. The specific reason is that this city wants to get a structural engineer's report on the city owned building next door to make sure removal of the wall would not have any adverse effects. That's Alright. Let me ask you this, mister Stallings. Would you object to us passing on your request for maybe 30, 60 days to give the city their opportunity to do whatever they're gonna do. And if we're not gonna do it indefinitely, I mean, I know that was recommended. I I think I really think that that again, this is property that we're, you know, something. Yes, sir. No, sir. I don't have objection, but the city's position is I think that we've gotta receive approval from you before they're Okay. Demolition permit. Okay. Oh, here's my thing, though. If the city is at okay. If we the first step is getting approval from the board. And we're getting approval from the board to say, yes, we are okay with removing of this wall. Alright? Yes. Then we have done our job. Then it falls on the city for the city to make the decision, the city to get the structural engineer, the city to approve the permit, the city to do anything else that they need to do. And it it removes this board and that complication from it and puts the decision on the city. At which case, if the city wants to go and get a new updated structure before this happens, they have a right to do so before they issue a permit. Thank you. Can we can I suggest then that if you approve the COE, there are there are some conditions? Number 1, the work does not start until the city has received the structural engineer's report. He can't do it anyway because he has to have the permit that's approved by the city. And if you're not willing if if you as a board are not willing to put conditions on it, that's entirely your choice. And I'm sorry. I'm getting hyped up and I'm not trying to get hyped up. It's it's entirely your choice. Okay. But I think the city has a right to be concerned about the city owned potentially historic building in a national register historic district, which was adjacent to this building on a wall that's been exposed since 02/2018. And I can't And I understand. We we don't disagree. We're just saying it's not our purview to say yay or nay on that. That's the city building department. The city isn't owner of the building. It has those has those Has those rights, but it's not Man make a motion? I'd like to approve the demolitionist building with the understanding that when, design proposals are available for what's going to go on the site, it comes back to the architecture review board for review. Second. All in favor? That's our job. I I know that that's our job, but there still needs to be something that covers that that says a little bit more about the structural, necessities. I I get that. I I understand that. I think what's being asked of us right now, and this is why I'm getting a little bit upset. Okay? Is I think the city is asking the board, okay, to say no to this so that they can then say the board didn't approve this versus the board the city being liable. And in my opinion, it is our job from the board's perspective to only look at this wall, and is this an acceptable project for this, and not make a decision relating around permit. This we're still giving the city the opportunity to do whatever the city needs to do. Structure reports, denial of the permits, whatever they mean to back up the other building that they, I believe that the boards I believe the board is there to assess the impacts on any buildings in a historic district. That's what you do. If someone comes in to build something new on that site, you will be assessing its impact on the adjacent buildings. So I don't see that there's that there's any difference there. I don't think you can look at things singularly piece by piece. You're responsible for all historic buildings and historic districts. I can suggest another motion if you're willing to to Let let me ask. Mister Stallings, would you, be willing to wait until the city gets their structural engineer report and see what it says. Because I do agree. Is there a possibility taking this fall down could hurt or damage an adjacent building? And with a structural engineering before answering that, sir, you need to say something? A a structural engineer report will assess the potential for for something to happen to that wall. It will also assess whether any repairs are going to be required to that wall through the removal of the other wall, and it will assess if there's been any moisture intrusion. So the engineer's report will really will really assess these things. Because I don't know if we've I've been through this situation before. Other folks may have and especially the architects, but you're talking about okay. This wall pocket. From what I'm hearing, it needs to come down. The question then becomes, okay. It's next to a building that is not historically designated at this time. But if you take this wall down, is it possible that it could damage the adjacent building? And I don't know what we would have to do then. I mean, you can't just leave it there because it's useless. And I've seen some of the, what was it, the wine base, some of the old mortar they used back in the 1860s, I think, when this was built. I lived in some. I got to see a lot of old buildings, things like that. I mean, this stuff is is dust. So Well, now the city has been, they have received a structural report from Gordon Davis. And then after their review of it, it was their determination. They didn't wanna join the 2 walls together. They wanted the wall to come down. They're going. And, that was given to Kibby Tate with the city. K. Yes, ma'am. And, sir, Robert Smith, city planning director. I think the structural report that, mister Stallings is referencing as as we had a meeting about it earlier this week is a 2018 structural report by by mister Gordon Davis. And so the intention is, the city is concerned that the wall would impact might impact the existing building. And so, the city is literally hiring a structural engineer to study that wall to determine whether or not there would be impact when it when and if it does get demolished. And so just to if I can give you a suggestion, maybe you give them you approve the certificate of appropriateness with the condition that the city, get a structural report, which they are. And if it if it meets the city's requirements, then the wall can come down. But you still you still give the certificate of appropriateness pending the city's, further review and approval. That's right. Robert did Rob. I'm sorry. Robert did Yes, sir. He mentioned mister Gordon's report. Did did mister, Davis's report? Did did he suggest either marrying the walls together or did he suggest taking it down? The, have you seen the report? You know there is a report? I I know that there is a report. Right. Y'all may be a little more familiar with the report. I haven't I haven't actually seen it. Okay. All that I've seen I I I think the only thing we've seen is a drawing is what's in the board in the agenda. By mister Davis, the structural engineer. That's right. All I received was what is in the agenda packet, with the drawing, and pictures. And it's got a 2018 date, which is why the city wants an updated formal structural report by a structural engineer. So let me try 1. We approve the demolition of the wall pending that the adjacent owner is allowed a chance to verify the structural integrity. And conditions for taking the wall down. And conditions for taking the wall down. I think that would work. That way it doesn't come back to us. Alright. Right. Right. Second. I'll You said did you second that? Sec I second it. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Alright. All in favor? Opposed? Thank heavens. We have an outstanding It it'll it'll be purely administrative. It it it would be purely administrative at this point on the city side. So y'all have Have have y'all employed someone, hired someone to get this done? Because again, I I don't want mister Stallings to have to wait a long Yes. The city is in process of hiring a structural engineer ASAP. Great. Let's get that done. I I would I would say if you don't, it's gonna come down on its own. It's not a good looking wall. I just Right. Right. Right. Right. It it'd be done better if it was done mechanically. Right. Alright. Thank you. Thank you. Kathleen Floyd. 3318 Lexington Road, Cloverdale Outlaw. Hi. I'm Catherine Floyd at Cloverdale, Ottawa. Alright. And requesting approval to add an enclosed porch and to, add some gutters in the back of the house to mitigate some rainwater issues and change the, roof color. Okay. Any questions from the audience? Any comments from the audience about this project? They are mute. Mute are your desires. I saw it and have no problems with it, so thank you. I thought it was a it will look nice. And I Been bad. I'm so sorry you had to go through that last little bitter night. I'm sorry. I I live in Cloverdale, Maaston Lane. So I've I've been by this house many times. I think this will be a very nice addition. I do I do 1 I have 1 concern. I'm not gonna disapprove anything, but I promise you I'm not. I'm very concerned about this area in the back of the house where the roof meets and the water looks like Niagara Falls coming this way. You know, the valley between the new construction and the old construction, it needs to be metal even if it's got the shingles on top of it. And I don't think that a standard size gutter is gonna be big enough to to catch this water, but it's gonna need to be, like, a 6 inch gutter or something like that across the back of the house. Okay. And and, you know, it's it's I had an architecture professors tell me 1 time as we grow up by something. Oh, that's a leaker. Well, you know, this is sort of like this is something that anybody can look at and say, oh, that's gonna be a problem. So just make sure that you keep your, you know, keep the gutters clean. It's which is a problem for me all the time. I have trees running my gutter right now, because it's so high. This 1 is at least close enough that you could get it on the ladder of reasonable lean. Yeah. Absolutely. Yeah. So that would be my only suggestion. Yeah. Will do. I'm not gonna make any more motions. I move to approve as submitted. Second. All in favor? All right. Thank you, ma'am. Thank you. And Debbie Shook, 2145 St. Charles Avenue. Good evening. Good evening. Hi. Well, I'm glad to be here, and I'm, asking for permission to add a, storage shed on the back part of my property. Used to have a, detached garage, that was taken down before I bought the house. And so I'm just looking to get, something to put things in. Outside storage. Yes. House side storage. Alright. My concern I'm just gonna, state this. I don't have a necessarily concern with the shed in the back. My concern is that it's plastic. So I understand that these are prefabricated units, but I really am concerned with just the material selection in the historic district. So Are there aluminum options that you might be thinking of? Yes. You can see 1 of those in figure number 6. I think that's the neighbors. It's the neighbors, but and it's much worse than what she's proposing. Have we ever approved of the vinyl shed? Approved of what? Last year? Yeah. The vinyl shed. I've wrecked my brain. I I don't think we have. I could be wrong. I've been on this for as long as you have. Most sheds I've seen, we we try to make them have a little bit of the character of the house. Yeah. It's not the shed's the problem, ma'am. It's it's the material. And, I mean, you you found something that was under a 100 square feet, you wouldn't have to deal with us. You just go talk to Sean and get it get it taken care of it. Anything under a 100 feet, he may have told you. If it's under a 100 feet, he can approve it administratively. If it's a 100 feet or over, then you get to come see us. Have you have you looked at some, other other sheds? I I did a cursory look at, what was available. And the reason I was going with this particular 1 is it was looked to be the best value for the money. Because I do, find, like, the wooden, prefabricated ones to be more attractive, but they're also 10 times more expensive. So And I went through the same thing about 3 and a half years ago, putting a shed in my backyard. I actually had someone build it, which was I could get it the way I wanted it, but then he also got paid the way he wanted. So I understand. Well, from a design point of view, I don't have any problem with this. It looks appropriate to be in the backyard of your house, and I wish that you could afford to stick build 1 that would that would echo the the design of your house because it's so handsome, but I understand that we're in an all night made of money. Yes. I I go back and forth on this 1 because typically we do not approve the vinyl fence or vinyl siding of any kind. However, a a shed, a a pre fab shed of any kind is temporary in nature. And this, I feel like, is even more temporary than a a wooden panel built prefab unit. I I agree with Elizabeth. The the appearance of it, the design of it overall, I don't have any issue with. I just struggle with the materiality of it, ultimately. See, I I agree with y'all that the look of it, I have no concerns with. No. Okay? But you said temporary. K? Here's my thing. How many times do we hear something's temporary and it we get 50 years down the road and it's still there. Yeah. And so that's where I say it needs we haven't, that I'm aware of, approved this material before. I think too, by approving it, we are then and it's right. We don't approve on offenses. We don't wanna product these out. So by approving this and this form, it gives an opportunity for someone in the future to also do this in 1 of our areas. So to for me, we need to either go with a metal or a wood sided shed that would meet the historic nature of the area. And I do understand the struggle, and I'm sorry. No. I and I totally understand that. I did look at metal, units, and there was not much out there that I felt would look attractive with my house. Mhmm. So that The wood that's across the fence is, is the typical of what you get on the metal. Mhmm. And, you know, it just that's to me sticks out as an. Can this be seen from any public way? Mine or the neighbors? No. Your your shed, is it going to be seen from from the street to the sidewalk? It's, figure 6 d. It's, it's, like, at the back of a driveway. Yeah. It would it's it's very obscure. Okay. You'd have to, like, kinda look pretty hard. Kinda reminds me of my first shed. If you slow down and look down the driveway, you could probably see it, but just driving by, you're not gonna see it. And, like, with the where I'm parking my car, like, you would have to look around the car to be able to see the shed itself. Yeah. Like, you'd have to be very nosy. I I think we're pretty much all in agreement. We had no problem with the shed. We don't have problems with the dimensions. It's gonna go on a pad that, I guess was an old garage. And and our concern being that, you know, we if we, guarantee you, if, you know, we approve a plastic shed, they're gonna start coming, because now and I don't know if you called for a motion, madam chair, but What what size is the, concrete slab that you got? And it looks like it's sloped as well. So it is, 20 feet by 20 feet. Okay. So your shed would just sit in the bridal, and you'd have concrete all you'd have concrete all the way around it, wouldn't you? Yes. There's there should be a picture, somewhere. There is. There is. There is. Yeah. Page 62. If she went to, like, the 8 by 10 shed versus the 8 by 13? Then it's up to Sean. Then it's up to If it's under a 100 feet, it can administratively be, approved. Correct? Yeah. Just to add though, it is the size part. The 8 by 10, I believe, is the size, but it is also materiality. In our expedited procedure, it says, you know, needs to be compatible with the house. So that would be wood, I would think, for this house. Yeah. So that's that's actually that's the reason why we're here, is the materiality again back to, what the board has, yeah, discussed here so far. Well, it is it is not it is not inconsistent with the decisions that we've made in the past as far as materials are concerned. Are you saying we have approved plastic? No. I said it's not consistent. Okay. That's what I thought. Miss Edna, bottom window here can hardly I hate to do this, but I think that just because it's not something that we would normally approve and that we have not improved it in the past, But I would ask you to look and see if you could find something that you can afford that that goes on this both of these things. Okay. That's a more traditional material. And and it's really not about you at all. It's really about us. If if we allow this, we're gonna get plastic sheds from here on into eternity, and it's it's really not in keeping with what we're supposed to do. Okay. While yours meets the visual, Amy, we will have some that definitely do not. Yeah. We don't want a little little tight shed out there that's been So may I ask, what material do I need to be looking for? I think wood is your safest bet. Okay. Because my concern with wood is it will deteriorate quicker. Yeah. And then I will have to be back here asking to have repairs done. And And that would harden If some are made out of hardipline, you could that would be fine too. Yeah. Yeah. And, wood and hardipline, you know, it can be maintained. It's about maintenance, you know, when we're talking about a natural material. So, I mean, yeah, plastic will last forever, but, you know, that can be seen as a negative as well. So I can certainly share if if the board is heading toward a denial. I can share the, expedited procedure, with you. And, you know, if if you're able to find something that meets that criteria, then I would just approve it on a staff basis. So that'll give you some information about the materiality. I don't think I shared it just because this is what you submitted and it didn't meet that, that expedited procedure. But, yeah, we can work toward something that, that would meet that. Okay. I'm sorry. What? We we still need a motion. Well, I was gonna actually make a motion to approve subject to the shed being constructed of either metal or wood and with consultation with mister Rose to ensure that it that's proper, consistent with the house, in other words. So if you do find something, then you can go ahead and and install it. And, again, if it's I I think that would be the better thing to do. Yeah. And that would keep the size what what is submitted. Right. You wanted it over a hunt you want 1 over a 100 feet. That's fine. Then you have approval. If you happen to find 1 that's I think I have mine built 96 feet. Didn't have to go through the architect through the board. If you find 1 that's 96 feet, just again So so really, it's it's not an approval. It's a denial of the plastic shed, but subject to going through the expedited process should you meet the criteria. Approval of the size, disapproval of the material. Yeah. I I didn't yeah. I guess that's what it boils down to. Is that what we're I mean No. Do we need a motion to deny? Yes. See, here's the I think you're trying to prove the side because the size because hers was a 103 square feet. Right. Hers? But That's the reason she's here because the size of the the square footage of the building is, over a 100 feet, a 100 feet or over. So it has come before us. I think he he said he wouldn't have approved the plastic rock regardless because it's plastic. Yeah. So it's both. So I so I I think it's denial of a plastic shed and subject to, resubmission of a bigger, larger wood or metal shed or hardiplank, or you could go through the expedited process. Yeah. You can do a denial and like you were saying Katie, give suggestions for resubmission, that that you all think would be approvable. So yeah. That that's a good way. And then if it is over like, if it doesn't still meet I guess what I'm trying to say, if it meets the expedited, procedure, then I'll just approve it. If it doesn't, then we would come back, with a revised, submittal. Okay. Okay. I moved to deny, the approval of the shed based on the materiality of the shed presented as plastic and not maintaining the materiality of the main house and the architectural fabric in which the house is seated. And, will allow for the expedited process of a woodshed or metals metalshed hardiplank, a material that is more fitting to the historic nature to follow the expedited process, with approval by the staff. Anything larger than that will be required to come to the board for approval. Second. All in favor? Opposed? Thank you. I'm sorry. The minutes of the last meeting were were, distributed to the board. Did anyone have any additions or corrections? Did just wanna note I messaged you all, I think, yesterday with a correction. So just wanna make sure you all got that, as a correction to the application or the approval for 1234 South Lawrence, from last month. Okay. Are there any other additions or corrections to the minutes? If not, they stand approved as corrected. Thank you, Sean.

To my here is vice chair, Kalia Bell, John Hayden, Jake Johnson, and Hillary Morgan.\n\nThank you. Alright. Warren Adams, Sean Rose, David Babb, and Nikhil Rose. Thank you. Thank you.\n\nThe first, project tonight is a fence in Capitol Heights, 125 North Lewis Street, Gloria Williams. Thank you. Tell us about your fence.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes. Miss Elizabeth, what did you just say?\n\nSpeaker 0: I said tell us about your fence.\n\nSpeaker 1: About my what? Is it a fence? Oh, I'm old, baby.\n\nSpeaker 0: That's alright.\n\nSpeaker 1: Me too. Old lady, but that's okay. Alright. And I got somebody here if I don't understand something. Okay?\n\nHow y'all doing this evening?\n\nSpeaker 0: We're fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: Y'all look good. So I hope y'all give me an approval. But, anyway, let me tell you about the fence. If you look at the property on the screen well, don't go for that because that's that's bad. Okay.\n\nRight there on the screen, that fence, when I bought that house in 2022, had a left fence that adjoined to the house that go all the way over to the end of the property line. What I did was, I have a brand new air conditioning unit that cost me almost $10,000, and I'm paying through Spectrum. I mean, I owe them too. But anyway, Duke I mean, the power company, Alabama Power. I'm from Charlotte, North Carolina, so I don't know the Alabama rules too good, but I'm learning them real fast.\n\nOkay. So that fence that you see over there, what I did was to try to protect my my air condition unit. My neighbor told me, miss Carol next door, she say, you need to cover your air condition unit because she say, somebody might try to steal it and steal your copper because they can just walk straight in. So what I did was I built like a l shape. So at the end of that fence, I came in about 3 feet and then went down 20 feet, went over 15 feet and made a fence so nobody couldn't take my union.\n\nBut then I thought they might can cut it. So I just put a little cover around it so they wouldn't see the fence on the side and in the back. And when you're standing at the end of the street, which is, not that good. Wilona. Yes.\n\nBecause I'm at the corner of Wilona And Lewis. When you stand at the end of my driveway, which is on Wilona, you can't even see my fence because I only went back, not at the end of the house, kinda in the middle. And then also that that line up to make that veil went up 20 feet, and it can't be seen. And I didn't know that I needed to do all of this, what I'm doing now, but I know now from mister Sean, who was very nice to me. Mister Sean Rose, that is.\n\nBut I'm asking because the people that put it up finished it, even though I asked them to stop. I had finished it when I got back home from the hospital. And so, mister Sean Rose told me I still need to get an approval, because I was supposed to get that at first. Me not being from here, from Charlotte, North Carolina, you know, I'm no 1. I know now.\n\nAnd I just ask that all of you, miss Cahill, mister Jake Johnson, miss Elizabeth Brown, miss Katie Williams, miss Hillary Morgan, and mister John Hayden, that y'all would give me an approval to protect my air conditioning unit. I might look young, but I'm 65. So I'm a old lady, and I live by myself, and I need an approval. And I know from now on, mister Sean told me always get a approval before something is done, but I know. So that's what I'm asking for tonight, and I appreciate you guys.\n\nSpeaker 0: Is there anyone in the audience to speak to this project?\n\nSpeaker 1: Ma'am?\n\nSpeaker 0: I'm I'm asking if there's anybody in the audience in your neighborhood that wants to talk about this project. I don't see anybody.\n\nSpeaker 1: What'd you say, babe? You're fine.\n\nSpeaker 0: You're fine. You're fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: I can't hardly hear or see the bifocals.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Miss Williams, she she's asking if anyone in the audience, wants to speak on on the project.\n\nSpeaker 1: I got I got a lady here to help me understand your ruling, but let's don't bring her up and see if I could try to help myself. I wanna try to help myself to stay where before I I don't wanna get dementia and stuff too bad. But mister Sean did tell me to bring somebody, and I bought a nice lady back there. She's a lady that I met since I've been here. I don't have no family.\n\nAll my family did. Mama, daddy's 2 sisters. I got 1 daughter that lives in New York. She's a lawyer. She said, mama, make sure you obey all the rules.\n\nYou got to find out before you do stuff, because I was crying about this. And she say yeah. And she say, but, mama, you got to find out. I say, okay. They explained to me, but she's here in case I don't understand something y'all tell me\n\nSpeaker 3: today. Thank thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: But she'll be here.

I ain't asking for much. I ain't asking for y'all to back me up trying to protect the neighborhood or nothing. I just want to be able to protect my activist.\n\nSpeaker 6: Miss Williams, I wanna I'm trying to get you, get you back to your\n\nSpeaker 1: seat. Oh, you ready for me to go? Yeah. Well, I don't joke. I don't have let me just say this before I go.\n\nI don't have no family here. My mom will pass. My daddy pass. No family. But that's why I wanna talk because I ain't got nobody to talk to.\n\nNo. No. You're fine.\n\nSpeaker 7: You're fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright, miss Vail. I'm gone.\n\nSpeaker 6: Yeah. I wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.\n\nStay right there.\n\nSpeaker 1: Stay right there. Stay right there. What do you want me\n\nSpeaker 6: to do now?\n\nSpeaker 1: I want you\n\nSpeaker 6: to stay right there.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Just stop talking. Yes. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 6: I move to approve as submitted.\n\nSpeaker 5: Second.\n\nSpeaker 0: All in favor?\n\nSpeaker 1: Hey. I have 1. Alright.\n\nSpeaker 0: Alright.\n\nSpeaker 1: God bless all of y'all, and I thank you from the bottom of my heart. And, mister Sean, thank you for explaining stuff to me. I appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 8: And enjoy your lovely house.\n\nSpeaker 1: Good. Your lovely air. Okay. I really enjoyed y'all. I really don't wanna leave, but that's okay.\n\nI'll go home. She gonna drop me off, and then I'm by myself again. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 0: Alright. Now we need to appoint a committee to go and\n\nSpeaker 4: visit. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 5: Why can't why can't every presenter be nice to come\n\nSpeaker 9: Hey. I'm\n\nSpeaker 4: sorry you\n\nSpeaker 0: missed that.\n\nSpeaker 5: I'm\n\nSpeaker 4: sorry. I am all here.\n\nSpeaker 5: Need to watch the re swag.\n\nSpeaker 1: K. Number 2.\n\nSpeaker 5: We're on number 2.\n\nSpeaker 0: Jean Mahan. Number 2, Howard Street. Gina has been set with entertainment value I\n\nSpeaker 10: I don't think I can compete.\n\nSpeaker 5: I'll give you a dollar if you can. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 10: I guess, the the what I'm hearing about is something that we got approved by the ARB last year. And, due to some timing and some other projects, I didn't get time to go get the variance. And now I'm back in front of you since you are all now doing the variances. So I'm asking for what we all agreed to last year, you know, pretty simply.\n\nSpeaker 5: I I guess when we approved the fence that the variances were still going through, which was it Warren? Who who handled?\n\nSpeaker 9: That would have been Board of Adjustment.\n\nSpeaker 5: And so since we approved Board of Adjustment, we now have the authority to grama variances and\n\nSpeaker 9: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 5: Okeydoke. That's what I thought.\n\nSpeaker 10: Make Yeah. I I was kinda surprised too.\n\nSpeaker 5: And I understand sometimes you get approval. I've done it myself where you don't start immediately and then something happens. But\n\nSpeaker 10: Yeah. And this was subject to, like, our neighbors had some comments that we acceded to. So, I think everybody was in agreement with the it was Okay.\n\nSpeaker 4: So this will be your name for\n\nSpeaker 0: this 1. Since we approved before.\n\nSpeaker 10: Yes. Alright.\n\nSpeaker 0: Warren, is there any particular language that needs to be in the motion to make the variance?\n\nSpeaker 9: Really just that you approve a 3 foot height variance and a 30 foot setback variance.\n\nSpeaker 1: I What? Wait.\n\nSpeaker 10: I I didn't quite hear that.\n\nSpeaker 9: You're requesting a 3 foot height variance Yes. And a 30 foot setback variance.\n\nSpeaker 11: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 10: The the main thing at issue was that in order to keep the fence level for the length, the ground drops off. And so we Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 5: We would\n\nSpeaker 10: bring in some fill dirt to build up Remember all? Height of the dirt at the end so that the fence would be at, a,\n\nSpeaker 5: continuous height. Yeah. Yeah. I think I remember we talked about that last time, didn't we?\n\nSpeaker 7: Yes. Yes.\n\nSpeaker 11: I think yeah.\n\nSpeaker 10: That's what the neighbors were mostly.\n\nSpeaker 5: Yeah. And I don't think yeah. That's what that was not a problem.\n\nSpeaker 10: Yeah. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 0: Is there anyone in the audience to speak to this project? Does anyone on the board have further comments?\n\nSpeaker 4: No. I move to approve the request of the 3 foot high variance and the 30 foot setback variance to be installed on the side yard property line as previously approved by the board.\n\nSpeaker 8: Second.\n\nSpeaker 0: Any all in favor? Opposed? Alright. You may go. Thank you.\n\nThank you.\n\nSpeaker 10: Be happy. I didn't try to annotate.\n\nSpeaker 0: Candice Frasier from Church of the Ascension Garden District. Well, now I'm sorry she's sending you 2 up because Candice would have jokes.\n\nSpeaker 5: She's been a\n\nSpeaker 12: bit start by clarifying that neither of us are Candice Frazier.\n\nSpeaker 5: You're not in high heels, so I know you're not.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. That's right. So I\n\nSpeaker 12: am Daniel Hughes, and this is Richard Norris. We are both members of Church of the Ascension and on the vestry. And we're here today to report back to him after the most recent meeting where, the church was requested to get, a structural little bit of a passion myself for historical redevelopment and have had the pleasure of working with, Gordon, our engineer that we engaged for about 32 years now. We've managed to save a few, but sometimes they're just so far gone that there's just nothing you can do. And that's really the bottom line here.\n\nWe'd like to talk a little bit about what the church's hopes and plans are here. Richard can speak to them. But, I would first ask if there's any questions about the report.\n\nSpeaker 6: We've heard we've heard this before. Right?\n\nSpeaker 4: The Yeah. This is what came up last time, and I don't if I can remember correctly and or correct me if I'm wrong. I don't think we had an issue with what was actually presented. The concern was just the fact that we didn't have a structural report Right. Back up the demolition for\n\nSpeaker 0: the board.\n\nSpeaker 4: So in my opinion, that has been provided. I read based on the way that the report read for everybody, basically, the structure would basically have to be demolished and brought back up. So\n\nSpeaker 5: Well, it indicates the floor and the roof and the side. Everything would have to be replaced according to mister Davis, who I happen to have used years ago when I bought my house to get a report. So, basically, what you're saying is you gotta rebuild the house. That's that's but I I But I believe it. And I guarantee, I mean, I haven't looked personally, but I'm sure, you know, the structure itself with the wiring and other interior You know, you you'd have to rebuild the house.\n\nWell, the\n\nSpeaker 12: church has just recently bought\n\nSpeaker 5: this. Right.\n\nSpeaker 12: The church did not only\n\nSpeaker 0: Alright. Is there anyone in the audience to speak to this project? That's that's fine\n\nSpeaker 5: Christina Cadden, GDP a president. Who's now\n\nSpeaker 0: I think I'll just take\n\nSpeaker 13: a minute. Can you Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 5: Can you I think it's\n\nSpeaker 7: on now.\n\nSpeaker 3: Okay. Hi. Christina Cadden, GDP a president. Typically, we would strenuously oppose any demolition in the Garden District. But, we have just discussed with the Church of the Ascension, and we do think that it is appropriate, especially because you guys provided the structural or the report that you guys provided that states that the house would basically need to be entirely redone, and it would help with a lot of issues that\n\nSpeaker 4: they'll be having right there. So we do support it. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 0: Alright. Questions or comments from the board?\n\nSpeaker 6: I move to approve and submit it.\n\nSpeaker 13: Second. All\n\nSpeaker 0: in favor? No. Opposed? And thank you. Thank you all.\n\nStallings and Sons about the remainder of the building at 39 North Perry Street.\n\nSpeaker 11: Thank you. I'm Rick Stallings, Stallings and Sons general contractors, and we've got a demolition application in with the city to remove the remaining wall that's standing, on 39 North Perry, the old Weber building. And I forwarded some drawings from structural engineer Gordon Davis showing where it proposed to either demolition, take it down, or marry it up with the wheel building wall. And that building is owned by the city, and they elected to not proceed with marrying it up and said they wanted the wall removed. And, also sent you some pictures of it also.\n\nOkay.\n\nSpeaker 0: Are there any comments from the audience about this project? Comments from the board.\n\nSpeaker 5: Mister Stallings, when the if you remove the this wall, what what is your site plan? What is what what do you intend for this particular, lot, I guess, once you remove the wall?\n\nSpeaker 11: Well, there's been some discussion to, to fill in the basement and and use it as a playground for a value across school. And there's all and or discussion to build a new structure there.\n\nSpeaker 0: Warren, may I ask what are the if something is new to be if something new is going to be done on this site, what sort of development requirements will the city have for the development of the project? Will it come back to the architecture review board for design review?\n\nSpeaker 9: Yes. Anything that goes there will have to come back to you. The the site is actually still designated. So so it will have to come back to you. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 5: And and just my own edification, when you have a single structure designation like this, it's actually the property, not the building itself that is historic.\n\nSpeaker 9: It's the 1. Yes.\n\nSpeaker 11: The site.\n\nSpeaker 5: So anything that goes on the property, you understand, mister Stallings, if you decide to put a playground or another building, you would have to submit plans to the board, for approval prior to deconstruction. Yes, sir. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 8: So it it's my understanding that we're supposed to give, whether or not it should be demolished, even though it was a landmark. I mean, the building's gone. I mean, it it is demolished. So what we're talking about is a wall. I in my opinion, I think that we allow the demolition, but it's not for us to say how it's being done.\n\nThe structural analysis and all that would have to go through the city building department. And that's not part of us. I'm sure you submitted to the building department for what you plan to do to get a permit and things like that.\n\nSpeaker 11: Correct. The\n\nSpeaker 9: the the city's position at the moment is that, the city would like to get a structural engineer to look at this before anything is demolished. There were a couple of issues with the with the application. It appears the drawing is dated in 02/2018. So the drawing is actually out of date and the city is in the process of bringing in a structural engineer to actually look at it because the city now owns the building next door, and this wall has been exposed for for many years. And so I believe the city wants to be prudent and have a structural engineer look at it before any any demolition takes place.\n\nSpeaker 8: And I agree with that, but I don't know if that's our place to say. I think that's where when you get a city permit, they request that not for us to stay here because we don't look at structural anything really. We look at the structural integrity product like the other building.\n\nSpeaker 5: With\n\nSpeaker 9: all with all due respect, you just structural report for a demolition.\n\nSpeaker 13: Yeah. And\n\nSpeaker 2: it is also, just for clarity, typically in or it is ARB policy to require site plans when we are approving a demolition of a main structure. This is a little bit of an odd situation where there's only a brick wall remaining. But normally, we would ask, like, if if they were asking to demolish a main building, we would ask for site plans, for whatever be what is to be developed there. So that is another consideration.\n\nSpeaker 5: Warren, does the city intend to I mean, I don't wanna put too much on mister Stallings. Is the city prepared to pay a structural engineer, someone like mister Davis, perhaps, to come in and look at it? And and, I mean, quickly, I mean, if if something's held up, we're kinda holding mister Stallings property. Yeah. From what he might do in the future, and I don't wanna do that.\n\nWhat do you know when the\n\nSpeaker 9: city We we've been informed that the city is in the process of acquiring an updated structural evaluation of the wall and the potential impact of its removal on the adjacent city owned building. And the concern is obviously that this has been exposed to the elements for some time and this actually only come up after the application had been submitted and it traveled further up the chain. And so there appears to be some concern from the city engineering department about what the impact could be on the adjacent building. Because we need to know if the exposed wall has to be sealed, if the exposed wall requires repairs, if water's penetrated through the exposed wall. And we're really taking our cues from the the building and the engineering department as to the potential damage that could have been caused over the years to the to the wall of the city building.\n\nSpeaker 4: I think when we talked about the last job, for instance, okay, at the church, for me, that's a full building. It's a full structure. Nothing happened. Okay? That when we're looking at a full structure in its entirety, that's where I can say, hey, I think we wanna structure a report to support that.\n\nIn a situation like this though, where we're looking at the wall. Okay? The rest of the building clearly isn't there. Okay? The basement, to me, is an open condition that's surrounded and can maintain a completely different thought process, in my opinion, in terms of safety related around that basement and in the condition that it's at.\n\nOkay? So I think that for us, on the board, my opinion is that they have a right to come. I'm in agreement with the removal of the wall. Okay? And the infill of the basement, right, to create a standard ground covering.\n\nI think that the conversation related around needing a structural engineer to look at it, I think that's fine and I can understand that point, but I think that really falls on the city. And the city permit department, which you have to have the permit in order to do the demolition. So I think ultimately for for me, unless I'm hearing otherwise, we as a board, they're coming to us asking for, can we do the project? I think the answer for myself is yes. Right?\n\nI support the removal of this wall and the infill of this location, Especially knowing that anything that's gonna be built there then has to come back to us for design review. But I think the removal of it then goes to the city for the per for the approval of the permit. And if they ask at that at that time that, hey. I'm on a structural, then that's the right of the city, but that's not necessarily the board.\n\nSpeaker 13: Yes. I I agree with what Hillary is saying. I think my biggest concern is in the event that any demolition occurs before the structural analysis is performed, we risk losing another building. We've lost 1 already, and I don't want to lose the building that the city's purchased because the wall it's not a party wall, but it's been probably leaning on this existing wall for many, many years. I don't know what this building dates back to.\n\nMy biggest concern is if demolition occurs without the due diligence, then losing a second building on this block that would just further degrade the downtown fabric.\n\nSpeaker 8: But is the due diligence our\n\nSpeaker 13: I don't see I'm not saying that it is. But I'm saying Or I think any any motion has to have the stipulation.\n\nSpeaker 8: It seems to me like the city would just deny them approval to do the actual demolition, deny the permit, you know, until they they create those what they want.\n\nSpeaker 6: I just feel like it's kinda this is, like, out of order. Like, we really just should be looking at what it is that you propose to put there, not necessarily anything to do with the demolition. Because like everybody's already said, the building's gone. So there's nothing for us to really speak to. But coming back to us and letting us know what you wanna do, that is where our approval would be necessary.\n\nSpeaker 4: I think the way I hear y'all, I think for me, Jake, is if the and, Kalia, if the thing is, hey, we approve, the removal of the wall, okay, in the infill, as noted, okay, With the stipulation that the city approves the permit for the removal of the wall. I think that ultimately\n\nSpeaker 6: So upon their approval, we do approve as well. Correct.\n\nSpeaker 5: Lehi me make sure I'm also getting correct in my mind. The city is concerned removal of this wall could affect have some adverse effect on the building that the city is purchased. Is that is that what what they're worried about?\n\nSpeaker 9: Yes. Yes. Which potentially could be eligible to be designated historic as well, and this is also the national register district. So you know there are concerns that, we we would want to know exactly what the condition of that wall is on the city building before anything is done because that wall has been exposed. These drawings date to 02/2018.\n\nSpeaker 5: Right.\n\nSpeaker 9: So it's been exposed at least since then to the elements, to to water, and the city is in the process of getting an engine a structural engineer's report\n\nSpeaker 5: to see exactly Well, the city, even if we if we were to approve the demolition, the city with mister Stallings requests, because you're gonna have to have a permit, correct, to take this ball down. Yes. Couldn't the city just say, wait a minute. We're going through some we're having it evaluated. We're not gonna issue it yet.\n\nIt's gonna we'll issue it subject to an adverse report or however they wanted to phrase it by by by the, structural engineer.\n\nSpeaker 0: Just to put this in a historical context, we approved the the work that was going to go on in this building that actually caused the building to fall down. So I think that but it's not our purview to to to, you know, do engineering or or structure review. That's the city building department. It's not our not our department. So I think we should just worry about whether or not this remnant of the historic building can be taken down.\n\nSpeaker 8: Have they given you a permit already?\n\nSpeaker 11: I'm sorry.\n\nSpeaker 8: Do you have a permit yet?\n\nSpeaker 2: A building permit may not be issued unless the ARB provides a certificate of appropriateness. Now now if a COA is issued, is granted, then, yes, a building permit or demolition permit will also be needed.\n\nSpeaker 8: So what we could say is we approve it pending that the city, does their due diligence on the structure.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, we didn't approve it for this for the architect to do the due diligence on the building before it collapsed. That's not our point of view.\n\nSpeaker 8: That's true.\n\nSpeaker 0: We're we're counting on the city and the architects and engineers to do their jobs, and sometimes things happen.\n\nSpeaker 11: Let me share this with you if you will, please. If you look at the structural engineer drawing that Gordon Davis prepared that I presented to\n\nSpeaker 0: you Mhmm.\n\nSpeaker 11: This on there. There was 2 proposals. 1 to marry up and connect these 2 walls. And the other 1 was to take the Weber Building wall down. Now there is a airspace in between these 2 existing walls.\n\nAnd if you and if you look, it's braced off at this time. When mayor Bridal was in office, We did a project for the city to remove the roof, put new trusses and a new roof on this building. And those braces will remain in place at the at the request of the structural engineer, Gordon Davis. Now that mortar is lime based mortar and which is no longer in existence, and you can take your finger and dig it out. That's the reason that wall is still braced.\n\nIf it wasn't, it'd come down on its own.\n\nSpeaker 5: I'd be honest with you. My concern is is is hazard. I mean, that if it were to come down and somebody in the area\n\nSpeaker 0: As the city's purview, we really don't have the expertise on this board to do that. And I think we just need to approve the demolition or not approve the demolition. That's our purview.\n\nSpeaker 6: Do we approve or disapprove pending? Can we do that pending?\n\nSpeaker 0: What It's not our job.\n\nSpeaker 5: I I I just look. It's not our job. I don't I I agree. I I don't think it's our job. Our job is to say, give you the permission to take it down or permission not to take it down.\n\nAnd we would have to state a specific reason for not taking it down. And right now, I can't think of 1.\n\nSpeaker 9: The specific reason is that this city wants to get a structural engineer's report on the city owned building next door to make sure removal of the wall would not have any adverse effects. That's Alright.\n\nSpeaker 5: Let me ask you this, mister Stallings. Would you object to us passing on your request for maybe 30, 60 days to give the city their opportunity to do whatever they're gonna do. And if we're not gonna do it indefinitely, I mean, I know that was recommended. I I think I really think that that again, this is property that we're, you know, something. Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 11: No, sir. I don't have objection, but the city's position is I think that we've gotta receive approval from you before they're Okay. Demolition permit.\n\nSpeaker 4: Okay. Oh, here's my thing, though. If the city is at okay. If we the first step is getting approval from the board. And we're getting approval from the board to say, yes, we are okay with removing of this wall.\n\nAlright? Yes. Then we have done our job. Then it falls on the city for the city to make the decision, the city to get the structural engineer, the city to approve the permit, the city to do anything else that they need to do. And it it removes this board and that complication from it and puts the decision on the city.\n\nAt which case, if the city wants to go and get a new updated structure before this happens, they have a right to do so before they issue\n\nSpeaker 8: a permit.\n\nSpeaker 0: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 9: Can we can I suggest then that if you approve the COE, there are there are some conditions? Number 1, the work does not start until the city has received the structural engineer's report.\n\nSpeaker 4: He can't do it anyway because he has to have the permit that's approved by the city.\n\nSpeaker 9: And if you're not willing if if you as a board are not willing to put conditions on it, that's entirely your choice.\n\nSpeaker 4: And I'm sorry. I'm getting hyped up and I'm not trying to get hyped up.\n\nSpeaker 9: It's it's entirely your choice. Okay. But I think the city has a right to be concerned about the city owned potentially historic building in a national register historic district, which was adjacent to this building on a wall that's been exposed since 02/2018.\n\nSpeaker 4: And I can't And\n\nSpeaker 5: I understand.\n\nSpeaker 8: We we don't disagree. We're just saying it's not our purview to say yay or nay on that. That's the city building department.\n\nSpeaker 0: The city isn't owner of the building. It has those has those\n\nSpeaker 4: Has those rights, but it's not Man make a motion?\n\nSpeaker 0: I'd like to approve the demolitionist building with the understanding that when, design proposals are available for what's going to go on the site, it comes back to the architecture review board for review.\n\nSpeaker 8: Second.\n\nSpeaker 0: All in favor? That's our job.\n\nSpeaker 6: I I know that that's our job, but there still needs to be something that covers that that says a little bit more about the structural, necessities.\n\nSpeaker 8: I I get that. I I understand that.\n\nSpeaker 4: I think what's being asked of us right now, and this is why I'm getting a little bit upset. Okay? Is I think the city is asking the board, okay, to say no to this so that they can then say the board didn't approve this versus the board the city being liable. And in my opinion, it is our job from the board's perspective to only look at this wall, and is this an acceptable project for this, and not make a decision relating around permit. This we're still giving the city the opportunity to do whatever the city needs to do.\n\nStructure reports, denial of the permits, whatever they mean to back up the other building that they,\n\nSpeaker 9: I believe that the boards I believe the board is there to assess the impacts on any buildings in a historic district. That's what you do. If someone comes in to build something new on that site, you will be assessing its impact on the adjacent buildings. So I don't see that there's that there's any difference there. I don't think you can look at things singularly piece by piece.\n\nYou're responsible for all historic buildings and historic districts. I can suggest another motion if you're willing to to Let let\n\nSpeaker 5: me ask. Mister Stallings, would you, be willing to wait until the city gets their structural engineer report and see what it says. Because I do agree. Is there a possibility taking this fall down could hurt or damage an adjacent building? And with a structural engineering before answering that, sir, you need to say something?\n\nSpeaker 9: A a structural engineer report will assess the potential for for something to happen to that wall. It will also assess whether any repairs are going to be required to that wall through the removal of the other wall, and it will assess if there's been any moisture intrusion. So the engineer's report will really will really assess these things.\n\nSpeaker 5: Because I don't know if we've I've been through this situation before. Other folks may have and especially the architects, but you're talking about okay. This wall pocket. From what I'm hearing, it needs to come down. The question then becomes, okay.\n\nIt's next to a building that is not historically designated at this time. But if you take this wall down, is it possible that it could damage the adjacent building? And I don't know what we would have to do then. I mean, you can't just leave it there because it's useless. And I've seen some of the, what was it, the wine base, some of the old mortar they used back in the 1860s, I think, when this was built.\n\nI lived in some. I got to see a lot of old buildings, things like that. I mean, this stuff is is dust. So\n\nSpeaker 11: Well, now the city has been, they have received a structural report from Gordon Davis. And then after their review of it, it was their determination. They didn't wanna join the 2 walls together. They wanted the wall to come down. They're going.\n\nAnd, that was given to Kibby Tate with the city.\n\nSpeaker 0: K.\n\nSpeaker 7: Yes, ma'am. And, sir, Robert Smith, city planning director. I think the structural report that, mister Stallings is referencing as as we had a meeting about it earlier this week is a 2018 structural report by by mister Gordon Davis. And so the intention is, the city is concerned that the wall would impact might impact the existing building. And so, the city is literally hiring a structural engineer to study that wall to determine whether or not there would be impact when it when and if it does get demolished.\n\nAnd so just to if I can give you a suggestion, maybe you give them you approve the certificate of appropriateness with the condition that the city, get a structural report, which they are. And if it if it meets the city's requirements, then the wall can come down. But you still you still give the certificate of appropriateness pending the city's, further review and approval.\n\nSpeaker 5: That's right. Robert did Rob. I'm sorry.\n\nSpeaker 7: Robert did Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 5: He mentioned mister Gordon's report. Did did mister, Davis's report? Did did he suggest either marrying the walls together or did he suggest taking it down? The, have you seen the report? You know there is a report?\n\nSpeaker 7: I I know that there is a report. Right. Y'all may be a little more familiar with the report.\n\nSpeaker 2: I haven't I haven't actually seen it. Okay. All that I've seen\n\nSpeaker 7: I I I think the only thing we've seen is a drawing\n\nSpeaker 5: is what's\n\nSpeaker 9: in the\n\nSpeaker 7: board in the agenda. By mister Davis, the structural engineer.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's right. All I received was what is in the agenda packet, with the drawing, and pictures.\n\nSpeaker 7: And it's got a 2018 date, which is why the city wants an updated formal structural report by a structural engineer.\n\nSpeaker 8: So let me try 1. We approve the demolition of the wall pending that the adjacent owner is allowed a chance to verify the structural integrity.\n\nSpeaker 0: And conditions for taking the wall down.\n\nSpeaker 8: And conditions for taking the wall down.\n\nSpeaker 7: I think that would work.\n\nSpeaker 8: That way it doesn't come back to us.\n\nSpeaker 7: Alright. Right. Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Second. I'll You said\n\nSpeaker 5: did you second that?\n\nSpeaker 6: Sec I second it.\n\nSpeaker 5: Okay. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: Alright. All in favor? Opposed? Thank heavens.\n\nSpeaker 8: We have an outstanding\n\nSpeaker 7: It it'll it'll be purely administrative. It it it would be purely administrative at this point on the city side. So y'all have Have\n\nSpeaker 5: have y'all employed someone, hired someone to get this done? Because again, I I don't want mister Stallings to have to wait a long\n\nSpeaker 7: Yes. The city is in process of hiring a structural engineer ASAP. Great. Let's get that done.\n\nSpeaker 8: I I would I would say if you don't, it's gonna come down on its own. It's not a good looking wall. I just\n\nSpeaker 7: Right. Right. Right. Right. It\n\nSpeaker 8: it'd be done better if it was done mechanically.\n\nSpeaker 7: Right.\n\nSpeaker 11: Alright. Thank you. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 0: Kathleen Floyd. 3318 Lexington Road, Cloverdale Outlaw.\n\nSpeaker 3: Hi. I'm Catherine Floyd at Cloverdale, Ottawa. Alright. And requesting approval to add an enclosed porch and to, add some gutters in the back of the house to mitigate some rainwater issues and change the, roof color. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 0: Any questions from the audience? Any comments from the audience about this project? They are mute. Mute are your desires.\n\nSpeaker 4: I saw it and have no problems with it, so thank you. I thought it was a\n\nSpeaker 3: it will look nice.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I\n\nSpeaker 5: Been bad. I'm so sorry you had to go through that last little bitter night.\n\nSpeaker 0: I'm sorry.\n\nSpeaker 5: I I live in Cloverdale, Maaston Lane. So I've I've been by this house many times. I think this will be a very nice addition.\n\nSpeaker 0: I do I do 1 I have 1 concern. I'm not gonna disapprove anything, but I promise you I'm not. I'm very concerned about this area in the back of the house where the roof meets and the water looks like Niagara Falls coming this way. You know, the valley between the new construction and the old construction, it needs to be metal even if it's got the shingles on top of it. And I don't think that a standard size gutter is gonna be big enough to to catch\n\nSpeaker 5: this water,\n\nSpeaker 0: but it's gonna need to be, like, a 6 inch gutter or something like that across the back of the house. Okay. And and, you know, it's it's I had an architecture professors tell me 1 time as we grow up by something. Oh, that's a leaker. Well, you know, this is sort of like this is something that anybody can look at and say, oh, that's gonna be a problem.\n\nSo just make sure that you keep your, you know, keep the gutters clean. It's which is a problem for me all the time. I have trees running my gutter right now, because it's so high. This 1 is at least close enough that you could get it on the ladder of reasonable lean. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 3: Absolutely. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: So that would be my only suggestion. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 3: Will do.\n\nSpeaker 0: I'm not gonna make any more motions.\n\nSpeaker 4: I move to approve as submitted. Second.\n\nSpeaker 0: All in favor? All right. Thank you, ma'am.\n\nSpeaker 3: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 0: And Debbie Shook, 2145 St. Charles Avenue.\n\nSpeaker 3: Good evening. Good evening. Hi. Well, I'm glad to be here, and I'm, asking for permission to add a, storage shed on the back part of my property. Used to have a, detached garage, that was taken down before I bought the house.\n\nAnd so I'm just looking to get, something to put things in.\n\nSpeaker 0: Outside storage. Yes. House side storage. Alright.\n\nSpeaker 4: My concern I'm just gonna, state this. I don't have a necessarily concern with the shed in the back. My concern is that it's plastic. So I understand that these are prefabricated units, but I really am concerned with just the material selection in the historic district.\n\nSpeaker 0: So\n\nSpeaker 6: Are there aluminum options that you might\n\nSpeaker 8: be thinking of? Yes.\n\nSpeaker 0: You can see 1 of those in figure number 6.\n\nSpeaker 8: I think that's the neighbors.\n\nSpeaker 0: It's the neighbors, but and it's much worse than what she's proposing. Have we ever approved of the vinyl shed?\n\nSpeaker 5: Approved of what? Last year?\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. The vinyl shed.\n\nSpeaker 5: I've wrecked my brain. I I don't think we have. I could be wrong. I've been on this for as long as you have.\n\nSpeaker 8: Most sheds I've seen, we we try to make them have a little bit of the character of the house. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 5: It's not the shed's the problem, ma'am. It's it's the material. And, I mean, you you found something that was under a 100 square feet, you wouldn't have to deal with us. You just go talk to Sean and get it get it taken care of it. Anything under a 100 feet, he may have told you.\n\nIf it's under a 100 feet, he can approve it administratively. If it's a 100 feet or over, then you get to come see us. Have you have you looked at some, other other sheds?\n\nSpeaker 3: I I did a cursory look at, what was available. And the reason I was going with this particular 1 is it was looked to be the best value for the money. Because I do, find, like, the wooden, prefabricated ones to be more attractive, but they're also 10 times more expensive. So\n\nSpeaker 5: And I went through the same thing about 3 and a half years ago, putting a shed in my backyard. I actually had someone build it, which was I could get it the way I wanted it, but then he also got paid the way he wanted. So I understand.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, from a design point of view, I don't have any problem with this. It looks appropriate to be in the backyard of your house, and I wish that you could afford to stick build 1 that would that would echo the the design of your house because it's so handsome, but I understand that we're in an all night made of money. Yes.\n\nSpeaker 13: I I go back and forth on this 1 because typically we do not approve the vinyl fence or vinyl siding of any kind. However, a a shed, a a pre fab shed of any kind is temporary in nature. And this, I feel like, is even more temporary than a a wooden panel built prefab unit. I I agree with Elizabeth. The the appearance of it, the design of it overall, I don't have any issue with.\n\nI just struggle with the materiality of it, ultimately.\n\nSpeaker 4: See, I I agree with y'all that the look of it, I have no concerns with. No. Okay? But you said temporary. K?\n\nHere's my thing. How many times do we hear something's temporary and it we get 50 years down the road and it's still there. Yeah. And so that's where I say it needs we haven't, that I'm aware of, approved this material before. I think too, by approving it, we are then and it's right.\n\nWe don't approve on offenses. We don't wanna product these out. So by approving this and this form, it gives an opportunity for someone in the future to also do this in 1 of our areas. So to for me, we need to either go with a metal or a wood sided shed that would meet the historic nature of the area. And I do understand the struggle, and I'm sorry.\n\nSpeaker 3: No. I and I totally understand that. I did look at metal, units, and there was not much out there that I felt would look attractive with my house.\n\nSpeaker 7: Mhmm.\n\nSpeaker 0: So\n\nSpeaker 5: that The\n\nSpeaker 0: wood that's across the fence is, is the typical of what you get on the metal. Mhmm.\n\nSpeaker 3: And, you know, it just that's to me sticks out as an.\n\nSpeaker 0: Can this be seen from any public way?\n\nSpeaker 3: Mine or the neighbors?\n\nSpeaker 0: No. Your your shed, is it going to be seen from from the street to the sidewalk?\n\nSpeaker 2: It's, figure 6 d. It's, it's, like, at the back of a driveway. Yeah. It would it's it's very obscure. Okay.\n\nYou'd have to, like, kinda look pretty hard.\n\nSpeaker 5: Kinda reminds me of my first shed. If you slow down and look down the driveway, you could probably see it, but just driving by, you're not gonna\n\nSpeaker 0: see it.\n\nSpeaker 3: And, like, with the where I'm parking my car, like, you would have to look around the car to be able to see the shed itself. Yeah. Like, you'd have to be very nosy.\n\nSpeaker 5: I I think we're pretty much all in agreement. We had no problem with the shed. We don't have problems with the dimensions. It's gonna go on a pad that, I guess was an old garage. And and our concern being that, you know, we if we, guarantee you, if, you know, we approve a plastic shed, they're gonna start coming, because now and I don't know if you called for a motion, madam chair, but\n\nSpeaker 8: What what size is the, concrete slab that you got? And it looks like it's sloped as well.\n\nSpeaker 3: So it is, 20 feet by 20 feet. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 5: So your shed would just sit in the bridal, and you'd have concrete all you'd have concrete all the way around it, wouldn't you?\n\nSpeaker 8: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 3: There's there should be a picture,\n\nSpeaker 5: somewhere. There is. There is. There is. Yeah.\n\nPage 62.\n\nSpeaker 8: If she went to, like, the 8 by 10 shed versus the 8 by 13?\n\nSpeaker 5: Then it's up to Sean.\n\nSpeaker 8: Then it's up to\n\nSpeaker 5: If it's under a 100 feet, it can administratively be, approved. Correct?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Just to add though, it is the size part. The 8 by 10, I believe, is the size, but it is also materiality. In our expedited procedure, it says, you know, needs to be compatible with the house. So that would be wood, I would think, for this house.\n\nYeah. So that's that's actually that's the reason why we're here, is the materiality again back to, what the board has, yeah, discussed here so far.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, it is it is not it is not inconsistent with the decisions that we've made in the past as far as materials are concerned.\n\nSpeaker 5: Are you saying we have approved plastic?\n\nSpeaker 0: No. I said it's not consistent.\n\nSpeaker 5: Okay. That's what I thought.\n\nSpeaker 0: Miss Edna, bottom window here can hardly I hate to do this, but I think that just because it's not something that we would normally approve and that we have not improved it in the past, But I would ask you to look and see if you could find something that you can afford that that goes on this both of these things. Okay. That's a more traditional material.\n\nSpeaker 8: And and it's really not about you at all. It's really about us. If if we allow this, we're gonna get plastic sheds from here on into eternity, and it's it's really not in keeping with what we're supposed to do.\n\nSpeaker 0: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 4: While yours meets the visual, Amy, we will have some that definitely do not.\n\nSpeaker 8: Yeah. We don't want a little little tight shed out there that's\n\nSpeaker 6: been So\n\nSpeaker 3: may I ask, what material do I need to be looking for?\n\nSpeaker 0: I think wood is your safest bet.\n\nSpeaker 3: Okay. Because my concern with wood is it will deteriorate quicker. Yeah. And then I will have to be back here asking to have repairs done.\n\nSpeaker 8: And And that\n\nSpeaker 5: would harden If some\n\nSpeaker 8: are made out of hardipline, you could that would be fine too.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Yeah. And, wood and hardipline, you know, it can be maintained. It's about maintenance, you know, when we're talking about a natural material. So, I mean, yeah, plastic will last forever, but, you know, that can be seen as a negative as well.\n\nSo I can certainly share if if the board is heading toward a denial. I can share the, expedited procedure, with you. And, you know, if if you're able to find something that meets that criteria, then I would just approve it on a staff basis. So that'll give you some information about the materiality. I don't think I shared it just because this is what you submitted and it didn't meet that, that expedited procedure.\n\nBut, yeah, we can work toward something that, that would meet that.\n\nSpeaker 0: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 5: I'm sorry. What?\n\nSpeaker 0: We we still need a motion.\n\nSpeaker 5: Well, I was gonna actually make a motion to approve subject to the shed being constructed of either metal or wood and with consultation with mister Rose to ensure that it that's proper, consistent with the house, in other words. So if you do find something,\n\nSpeaker 12: then\n\nSpeaker 5: you can go ahead and and install it. And, again, if it's I I think that would be the better thing to do.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. And that would keep the size what what is submitted.\n\nSpeaker 5: Right. You wanted it over a hunt you want 1 over a 100 feet. That's fine. Then you have approval. If you happen to find 1 that's I think I have mine built 96 feet.\n\nDidn't have to go through the architect through the board. If you find 1 that's 96 feet, just again\n\nSpeaker 8: So so really, it's it's not an approval. It's a denial of the plastic shed, but subject to going through the expedited process should you meet the criteria.\n\nSpeaker 13: Approval of the size, disapproval of the material.\n\nSpeaker 5: Yeah. I I didn't yeah. I guess that's what it boils down to. Is that what we're I mean\n\nSpeaker 0: No. Do we need a motion to deny? Yes.\n\nSpeaker 4: See, here's the I think you're trying to prove the side because the size because hers was a 103 square feet.\n\nSpeaker 5: Right. Hers? But That's the reason she's here because the size of the the square footage of the building is, over a 100 feet, a 100 feet or over. So it has come before us.\n\nSpeaker 8: I think he he said he wouldn't have approved the plastic rock regardless because it's plastic.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. So it's both.\n\nSpeaker 8: So I so I I think it's denial of a plastic shed and subject to, resubmission of a bigger, larger wood or metal shed or hardiplank, or you could go through the expedited process.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. You can do a denial and like you were saying Katie, give suggestions for resubmission, that that you all think would be approvable. So yeah. That that's a good way. And then if it is over like, if it doesn't still meet I guess what I'm trying to say, if it meets the expedited, procedure, then I'll just approve it.\n\nIf it doesn't, then we would come back, with a revised, submittal. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 4: Okay. I moved to deny, the approval of the shed based on the materiality of the shed presented as plastic and not maintaining the materiality of the main house and the architectural fabric in which the house is seated. And, will allow for the expedited process of a woodshed or metals metalshed hardiplank, a material that is more fitting to the historic nature to follow the expedited process, with approval by the staff. Anything larger than that will be required to come to the board for approval.\n\nSpeaker 8: Second.\n\nSpeaker 0: All in favor? Opposed? Thank you. I'm sorry. The minutes of the last meeting were were, distributed to the board.\n\nDid anyone have any additions or corrections?\n\nSpeaker 2: Did just wanna note I messaged you all, I think, yesterday with a correction. So just wanna make sure you all got that, as a correction to the application or the approval for 1234 South Lawrence, from last month. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 0: Are there any other additions or corrections to the minutes? If not, they stand approved as corrected. Thank you, Sean.
